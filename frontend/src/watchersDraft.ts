 * Pure draft logic for the Settings page's watcher editor, hoisted out of the
 * component so it is unit-testable (see CLAUDE.md: the frontend tests cover the
 * pure modules, never a rendered tree).
 *
 * The same two things [`pricingDraft`](./pricingDraft.ts) models, for the one
 * value this section edits:
 *
 * - **Blank means "use the built-in default"**, exactly as a blank command box
 *   means "use the built-in template". A blank box is PUT as `null`, which
 *   removes the key and restores the limit mesa ships.
 * - **The limit is edited as text, not as a number.** A half-typed `""` or
 *   `"1"` has to survive a keystroke, so the draft holds a string and only
 *   `changedWatchers` converts — parsing per render would clobber typing.
