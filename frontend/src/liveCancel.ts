/**
 * What the `live-cancel` key (Escape by default, mesa task 1354) does to a
 * live conversation: `'discard'` drops everything the microphone has heard
 * and not yet sent and mutes it, `'resume'` opens it again, `null` leaves the
 * keystroke to whatever else wants it.
 *
 * Offered on the listen switch's own terms — a live conversation this browser
 * has joined, with a microphone that could open — because outside them there
 * is nothing to discard or mute, and swallowing the busiest key on the
 * keyboard for nothing is worse than doing nothing. A **pause** stands it
 * down too: a pause keeps the held recording for Resume, so there is no
 * utterance in progress to throw away, and a mute laid under the pause would
 * silently outlast it.
 *
 * `'resume'` only undoes **its own** mute. A microphone the person shut with
 * the switch or the chord stays shut on Escape: Escape is the key a person
 * presses to back out of anything, and a stray one must never be what opens a
 * microphone the person closed on purpose.
 *
 * Two facts about the keystroke itself stand it down: another listener having
 * already claimed it (`defaultPrevented` — every Escape that closes a dialog,
 * a menu or a bar marks it, and the hub reads this after every listener has
 * run), and an IME composition, where Escape cancels the candidate.
