  // *Vertically* this one can be a real `scrollIntoView`, unlike the editor's:
  // the current match is a real element in the highlight layer, so the browser
  // is the thing that knows where it ended up — no line arithmetic, and it is
  // correct with soft wrap on as much as off. What the browser will not do is
  // *not* scroll: `block: 'center'` re-centres unconditionally, so stepping
  // between two matches a screenful apart threw the file by half a pane on every
  // Enter while the editor, whose `scrollTopForBox` returns the scroll it was
  // given for a box already in view, sat still on the same keystroke. Asking
  // first (`boxNeedsReveal`) is what makes the two panes answer alike. The band
  // it is asked about is not the scrollport: `.files-content-top` is pinned over
  // its top and the status bar over its bottom, and a match painted under either
  // is not one the reader can see — the vertical twin of the gutter lead-in
  // below. `block: 'nearest'` is not that answer, since it would land the match
  // flush at the scrollport's top edge, i.e. behind the header.
  //
  // Sideways it cannot be a `scrollIntoView` at all, and that is not a second
  // answer to the same question but the one thing the call does not know:
  // `.files-code-gutter` is `position: sticky` over the left edge of
  // `.files-code-scroll`, and `inline: 'nearest'` aligns a match lying left of
  // the current view flush to that edge — under the numbers, with the counter
  // and the `.current` class both reporting success. It is the same overlay the
  // editor's `scrollLeftForBox` lead-in exists for, so it is the same call: the
  // scroller has a real `scrollLeft`, the gutter a real `offsetWidth` and
  // `.files-code-main` the same 0.5rem channel past it the editor's computed
  // `padding-left` already includes — so a match revealed from the left arrives
  // with a column of code beside it in *both* panes, rather than abutting the
  // numbers in one of them. Measured off rects rather than `offsetLeft` because
  // the mark's offset parent is `.files-code-main`, one box in from the
  // scroller.
  //
  // A **landing** arms it too (task 813), and by the same kind of flag rather
  // than by watching `landing`: the pane is being *rendered* with the panel's
  // answer in place (`landingActive`), and the mark to measure exists only

  // to handle. `revealedLanding` is the once-per-`seq` guard; a second click on
