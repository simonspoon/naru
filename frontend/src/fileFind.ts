// is a user's typing, not a pattern language: `RegExp` would turn `(` into a
// syntax error and `.*` into a surprise, and building one from arbitrary text
// is the same class of mistake as splicing a value into a shell string.

 * the reveal deliberately leaves the textarea unfocused while the find bar steps
 * (`CodeEditor.reveal`), so the browser never scrolls the selection into view by
 * itself. The viewer *has* an element to scroll to and uses `scrollIntoView` for
 * the vertical half — but `inline: 'nearest'` aligns a match lying left of the
 * view flush to the scrollport's left edge, i.e. behind the sticky gutter, since
 * nothing tells the browser that band is covered. One pane arrives here from
 * arithmetic it cannot do and the other from a call that does not know about
 * overlays; the answer is the same either way.
