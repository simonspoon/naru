// `CodeEditor` for the reason the other pure modules do: a gutter that is one
// line out, or a caret that reports the wrong column at a CRLF boundary, is
// invisible in a screenshot and obvious in a unit test — and these are exactly
// the predicates that historically shipped wrong.
//
// Two line counts, deliberately not one. An editor shows a trailing newline as
// a real, empty last line the caret can sit on; a `<pre>` swallows exactly
// one. So
// `lineCount` answers for the editor and `viewerLineCount` for the read-only
// pane, and each gutter is built from the count of the thing it sits beside.
