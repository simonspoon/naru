/**
 * What the person is looking at, on its way from the page that knows to the
 * hub that reports it (mesa task 888).
 *
 * The route alone says which page is open; it does not say what is *in focus*
 * on it — which file the editor holds, which workflow the canvas is showing,
 * which task the panel opened. That is the half a spoken conversation needs:
 * "rename this" is only answerable if mesa knows what "this" is.
 *
 * Why a module-level channel and not a prop or a context provider: `LiveHub`
 * is rendered inside `<header>` and is mounted for the life of the app, while
 * the pages are deep in the routed tree underneath it — there is no ancestor
 * the two share except `App`, and threading a setter down through every page,
 * tab and pane to reach one telemetry field would put a wire through the whole
 * tree for a value nothing in the tree reads. So the pages publish here and the
 * hub subscribes: **one poster, one report**. The hub stays the only thing that
 * talks to `/api/live/route`, exactly as it is the only thing that talks to
 * the rest of the live surface — mesa does not open a second write path.
 *
 * The channel is deliberately plain: a value, a setter and a subscriber list,
 * synchronous and dependency-free. The tested logic below it (normalize, equal)
 * is pure and knows nothing about React; only the hook at the bottom of the
 * file does.

 * file path is a perfectly ordinary focus, and a report that is 422'd tells the

 *
 * The effect is keyed on the *value*, not the object: pages build their context
 * inline, so a bare object dep would re-run on every render. `sameContext` is
 * what makes that safe, and the serialized fields are what make it a dep React
 * can compare.
 *
 * Standing down is deliberately **conditional**, because the cleanup runs on
 * every change of that key and not only on unmount. Clearing unconditionally
 * would publish a transient "nothing selected" between every two focuses — and
 * since the hub debounces, a timer that happened to fire inside that gap would
 * tell the agent nothing is open at the exact moment the person changed what
 * they are looking at. The same hazard runs across a route swap, where the
 * arriving page's effect can run before the departing page's cleanup. So a
 * publisher only clears what is still *its own* value; one that has already
 * been superseded simply stops talking.
