/**
 * The page-side watchdog over the live agent (mesa task 1157).
 *
 * By voice, silence is confusing: the agent may be thinking or may be stuck
 * on a Claude Code permission prompt nobody can see — and it cannot report
 * the prompt itself, so the *page* does. One report, posted to
 * `POST /api/live/notice` and written by the server as a `mesa` turn (spoken
 * once, labelled in the transcript, deduped per working span by
 * `Store::add_live_notice`):
 *
 * - `permission` — `GET /api/live` answers a non-null `blocked` (the job's
 *   `waitingFor`, read off `claude agents`) where the previous poll answered
 *   null — the **rising edge** — and no such notice exists in this span yet.
 *
 * - `agent-ended` (naru task 1894) — `GET /api/live` answers a non-null
 *   `agent_ended` (the agent's `naru run` is over: finished, failed, stopped
 *   or its runner died) where the previous poll answered null, and no such
 *   notice exists in this span yet. A page that loads with the run already
 *   over sees that as the edge too; the server's dedupe covers a repeat.
 *
 * A second report, `stalled` (working and silent for 30 s), was removed by
 * mesa task 1218: real work routinely runs longer, so it was spoken on
 * almost every turn and told the person nothing.
 *
 * The permission notice is edge-triggered rather than level-triggered because
 * `blocked` is a cached read (5 s server-side): the prompt being answered
 * opens a new working span while the cache still says "permission prompt",
 * and a level rule would report the prompt again in the new span. A value
 * that merely persists across a span change is not news; only null → non-null
 * is. The server's per-span dedupe stays as the second line. Every decision
 * here is a pure function of its inputs, so `LiveHub` only performs them, on
 * every poll.
