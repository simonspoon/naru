 * difference: the queue is not a snapshot. A live conversation keeps arriving,
 * so the next item is always chosen from what is on hand *now*, minus what the
 * page has already taken in hand (`handled`) — which is what keeps a turn that
 * failed to speak, or one the server has not yet stamped `played_at` for, from
