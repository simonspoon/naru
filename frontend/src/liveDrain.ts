 * overlapping posts to `/api/live/transcribe` can never land the halves of one
 * thought the wrong way round. Before this module that chain was local to one
 * run of the capture effect, and the person's own switch was the one teardown
 * that lost text: the press flushed the recording at once, so a segment still
 * in flight — and the utterance the teardown cut with `vadCut` — settled after
 * the mute and failed the delivery-time gate. The chain now outlives a capture
 * run: every run enqueues onto the tail of the last, `close()` is the switch,
 * and a flush that has to wait is one more step in the same order — old
 * segments, then the flush as one turn, then whatever the next run hears — so
 * a mute, an unmute and a second mute cannot interleave what they send.
 *
 * Deliberately not the recording itself: the held text stays in `LiveHub`'s
 * own state, folded through `heldWith` exactly as before. This is only the
 * sequencing and the two counts the gate below needs.
