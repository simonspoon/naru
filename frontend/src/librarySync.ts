 * status, one row, one resolution, decided the same way everywhere.
 *
 * A resolution is one of three choices, matching the API
 * (`.scratch/library-design.md`): `mesa` (push the stored body to disk),
 * `disk` (pull the file's body into mesa) or `skip` (do nothing, move the
 * baseline not at all). There is deliberately no fourth "merge" choice — the
 * modal shows both bodies and the user picks a side.

 * radio-group `name` for a row's mesa/disk/skip picker: a bare `row.path` in
 * either spot lets two same-path rows interfere — clicking one row's radio
 * silently unchecks the other's (native HTML radio grouping is keyed by
 * `name` alone), and a stale row can survive a refetch (a React key
 * collision leaves an old node behind across the diff). The index is safe to
