/**
 * Renders frame card text as markdown, treating the source strictly as DATA.
 *
 * Safety: react-markdown does NOT pass raw HTML through — there is no
 * `rehype-raw` plugin here, so any embedded HTML (e.g. `<script>` or
 * `<img onerror=…>`) is rendered as inert text, never as live DOM. We do not
 * enable `allowDangerousHtml`/`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere. Card
 * titles/descriptions may be untrusted, so this is the only path that turns
 * their text into formatted output.
 *
 * Links open in a new tab with `rel="noreferrer"` so a card cannot leak the
 * referrer or hijack the opener. URL protocols are sanitised by react-markdown's
 * default URL transform (javascript: and other unsafe schemes are stripped).
 *
 * `remark-gfm` adds the GitHub-flavoured extensions core CommonMark lacks —
 * tables, strikethrough, task lists, autolinks (task 432). It is a source-text
 * parser extension only: it emits ordinary mdast nodes, so the no-raw-HTML
 * guarantee above is unaffected.
 *
 * `breaks` opts into `remark-breaks`, which turns a single newline into a hard
 * line break instead of CommonMark's soft break (collapsed to a space). Used
 * where a body is a line-per-item list that must not run together. Like
 * `remark-gfm` it is a source-text parser extension emitting ordinary mdast
 * nodes, so the no-raw-HTML guarantee is unaffected.
 *
 * Fenced code blocks render as literal blocks colour-coded by language
 * (task 521). The `pre` override reads the single `<code>` child react-markdown
 * nests inside every block, pulls its ```` ```lang ```` tag from the
 * `language-*` class, and — when we carry a Prism grammar for it (see
 * `prismGrammar`) — hands the verbatim text to `SyntaxHighlighter`. This stays
 * inside the no-raw-HTML guarantee: the highlighter tokenises the string into
 * inert `<span>`s, it never interprets the content as markup. Unknown/no
 * language falls back to a plain `<pre>` — still a literal block, just
 * uncoloured. Inline code (no enclosing `pre`) is untouched and keeps the
 * default `<code>` chip.
 *
 * `resolveImageSrc` lets a caller rewrite `![alt](src)` sources (task 801).
 * It receives the source text verbatim and returns the URL to actually load,
 * or `null` for "render no image at all" — in which case the alt text renders
 * as inert muted text rather than a broken-image icon. Only the Files tab
 * passes it, to turn a relative path in a repo file into that repo's raw-file
 * route; every other caller omits it and keeps react-markdown's default
 * `<img>` (an absolute `http(s)` src renders exactly as it does today).
 * react-markdown's URL sanitisation runs before this hook either way, so an
 * unsafe scheme never reaches the resolver.

 * border/background around EVERY line box, so a block renders as a stack of

 * INLINE style, so only `customStyle` can displace it (no class rule, at any
 * specificity, wins against it). The whole-file viewer and the editor overlay
 * already sidestep it by rendering on `background: transparent`; a markdown
 * block is a slab inside prose, so it takes the theme's own raised-panel
 * tokens instead — the same background/border pair as `.files-frontmatter`
 * and every other inset panel. Token colours are untouched: they stay
 * identical to the ones the Files viewer paints for the same language.
 *
 * The plain (no-grammar) path takes the same object rather than a CSS twin,
