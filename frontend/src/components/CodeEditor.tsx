/** The app's one syntax-highlighting text editor (task 658, lifted out of
 * FilesView in task 785): the same Prism colouring the read-only panes use,
 * but live under the caret.
 *
 * A `<textarea>` can only paint one colour, so the highlighted copy is a
 * separate, inert layer *behind* a transparent-text textarea — the standard
 * overlay editor. Everything that keeps the two aligned is load-bearing:
 * identical font metrics and zero padding on both (`.files-editor-*` in
 * App.css), `wrap="off"` so the textarea never soft-wraps where the `<pre>`
 * would not, `highlightOverlaySource` for the trailing-newline mismatch, and
 * scroll mirrored from the textarea onto the layer on every scroll event.
 * Only the textarea is a real control: the layer is `aria-hidden` and
 * pointer-transparent, so selection, the caret and the accessibility tree all
 * still come from the one element that holds the text.
 *
 * The line-number gutter (task 809) is a third layer of the same stack, driven
 * by the same mirrored scroll, `aria-hidden` and unselectable so a copy of the
 * code never carries line numbers with it. It is opaque and pinned over the left
 * edge of the textarea's own scrollport, which is what makes a long line scroll
 * *under* it rather than past it — and what both reveals into that box then have
 * to be told about, since the padding clearing the text is scrollable content
 * rather than a reserved strip: neither the browser's own caret reveal
 * (`scroll-padding-left`, in App.css beside that padding) nor this file's find
 * reveal (`scrollLeftForBox`'s lead-in) would otherwise leave the band clear,
 * and a caret parked under the numbers is text the user types and deletes
 * without seeing it. It is hidden outright while `wrap`
 * is on: a soft-wrapped logical line occupies several visual rows, so a gutter
 * numbering logical lines cannot stay beside them, and there is no measurement
 * this component could take that would not be a frame behind the typing. Hiding
 * it is the one solution that cannot desync — VS Code's alternative (numbering
 * visual rows) needs the browser to tell us where each wrap fell, which it
 * won't.
 *
 * "Wrap on means no line numbers" is therefore a known, deliberate gap rather
 * than an oversight, and the obvious fix does not apply here. Every editor that
 * keeps numbers under wrap gives each logical line its own grid row — a gutter
 * cell beside a code cell that is as tall as that line wrapped — which needs
 * the code split into one element per line. The code here is a single
 * `<textarea>`, one element by definition and the only thing holding the caret,
 * the selection and the undo stack; there is no per-line box to put in a row.
 * (The read-only pane has the same wall for a different reason: its code is one
 * Prism tree whose spans cut across line boundaries, and cutting it into rows
 * means rewriting somebody else's markup by offset — the thing `FindLayer`
 * exists to avoid.)
 *
 * A language we carry no grammar for falls back to a plain textarea in the same
 * stack — same gutter, no colours — matching `FileCode`'s plain `<pre>`.
 *
 * Find matches (task 809, slice 3) are a fourth layer of the same stack, on the
 * same terms: the offsets are decided by `fileFind.ts`, the layer only paints
 * them, and it exists rather than relying on the textarea's own selection
 * because the find bar keeps focus while stepping and an unfocused selection is
 * faint-to-invisible depending on the engine.
 *
 * The IDE editing behaviours (task 809) — Tab/Shift+Tab indent, Enter's
 * auto-indent and brace expansion, auto-closing and typing over a pair — are
 * decided entirely by `editorInput.ts`; this file only applies what it answers,
 * and `null` means the keystroke was never touched. Applying it goes through
 * `document.execCommand('insertText')` rather than an assignment, because
 * setting a textarea's value from script wipes the browser's undo stack: one
 * auto-indent would otherwise cost the user every keystroke typed before it.
 * `replacementRange` is what makes that possible — execCommand only ever
 * replaces the current selection, so the span to select first has to be derived
 * from the two documents. Where the command is refused (an old engine, a
 * non-browser test environment) the plain `onChange` is the fallback: correct
 * text, forfeited undo, never a dropped keystroke. Either way the caret is
 * restored in a layout effect, before the browser paints, so it never flashes
 * at the end of the line.
 *
 * Two things about those keys are the file's, not this repo's. The indent unit
 * is detected from the text being edited (`detectIndentUnit`), because this box
 * browses arbitrary repos — a fixed two spaces indents a four-space Rust file
 * wrongly and a tab-indented shell script *mixedly*. And because Tab is taken
 * from the browser, Escape arms the next Tab as a plain focus move
 * (`tabEscapeAfter`), the CodeMirror convention: without it the Scripts page's
 * body box — one field of a form, with no `onCancel` — has no forward-Tab out
 * of it at all, which is a keyboard trap rather than an editor.
 *
 * There is exactly one of these. Both callers (the Files tab's editor and the
 * Scripts page's shell-body box) mount it rather than forking the overlay
 * mechanics, because a copy that drifts a single CSS metric shears the
 * colours off the caret with nothing to catch it. */

        // caret. Literally the read-only pane's layer — one `FindLayer`, so
        // the two cannot disagree about which match is current — placed and
        // aligned by this stack's own rules: identical text through
        // `highlightOverlaySource` (so the trailing-newline mismatch is
        // handled once, the same way the colours are), identical metrics
        // inherited from the stack, and the same mirrored scroll. It is
        // what makes a match visible at all while focus stays in the query box
        // (see `reveal`): a background here shows through both the transparent
        // textarea and the coloured layer beneath it.
