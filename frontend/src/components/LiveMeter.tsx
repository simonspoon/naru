/**
 * The head's level meter (mesa task 1069): twelve bars of how loud this room
 * has been, newest on the right.
 *
 * It replaces the single fill bar that used to sit beside the listen switch,
 * and it answers the same question that one did — a one-shot transcription has
 * no partial result to show mid-segment, so the meter is the auris path's only
 * sign the microphone is doing anything at all. A *history* rather than a
 * level because the head is read at a glance: one bar rising and falling says
 * "something", twelve say whether the last second was a sentence or a cough.
 *
 * Its own component, and its own state, for `NaruMark`'s reason: the row
 * advances twelve times a second, and `LiveHub` is not a tree to re-render at
 * that rate. Everything the loop reads lives in a ref; the only state is the
 * finished row, written on the frames that actually change it
 * (`pushMeterHistory` hands back the same array on the other four in five).
