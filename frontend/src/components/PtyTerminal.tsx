// drag or an Auto Tile rebuild produces a resize per animation frame, and each
// one is a real SIGWINCH to the TUI on the other end; only where the drag
// *stops* is a size anybody meant. Long enough to swallow a drag, short enough

 * instead of a hand-copied (and driftable) second implementation —
 * `AgentTerminal` is now a thin wrapper over this component.
 *
 * Wire protocol (see src/api.rs's shared `pump_pty`): server→client binary
 * frames are raw PTY output; client→server binary frames are keystrokes and
 * text frames are JSON control (`{"resize":{cols,rows}}`). Closing this
 * component only tears down its own socket/pty — whatever's on the other
 * end (a `claude attach` bridge or a raw shell) is the caller's concern via
 * `closedMessage`'s wording, not this component's.
