/**
 * Mesa Live, in the header (mesa tasks 855, 857): the whole conversation lives
 * here now, not on a routed page.
 *
 * The person just talks: joining a live conversation opens the microphone on
 * its own (task 917) through page-side audio capture (`liveAudio.ts`,
 * `liveVad.ts`, task 956) — an `AudioWorkletProcessor` hands this component
 * raw blocks, a voice-activity state machine decides where one utterance ends
 * and the next begins, matching the breath the browser's `SpeechRecognition`
 * used to settle a final result on, and each finished segment is posted as a
 * WAV to `POST /api/live/transcribe`, which hands it to the external `auris`
 * binary and answers with text — **where a machine has it installed**. Task
 * 957 makes that an upgrade rather than a dependency: a probe on mount
 * (`transcribeStatus`, beside the config's `listen.engine`) decides between auris and the browser's own
 * `SpeechRecognition` (task 873's original path, restored rather than
 * replaced) as this page's `ListenPath` (`liveRecognition.ts::listenPath`),
 * and only one of the two capture effects below ever runs at a time. That
 * text enters the **existing** held-
 * recording path (`liveRecognition.ts`, task 873) completely unchanged: it
 * **holds** every settled utterance and sends the whole recording as one
 * `user` turn once the person goes quiet — the wait `live.auto-send-ms`
 * names — with the listen switch (the `live-listen` chord or the panel's
 * button, task
 * 887) as an explicit early send; the same press is also what mutes the
 * microphone and keeps it muted for the rest of that session. The capture box
 * in the conversation panel stays as the fallback — a browser with no way to
 * capture audio, or a refused microphone, is the surface as it was: system
 * dictation types into the box once the person has clicked into it, and a line is
 * sent by Enter alone (mesa task 977). Either way this is now the **only**
 * place audio leaves the page: each segment travels once, as one bounded WAV, to that one
 * route, decoded locally by `auris` and never retained (`docs/live.md`). An
 * agent spawned by `Go live` pulls those over the CLI and answers with `mesa live say`,
 * which lands here as a `mesa` turn and is spoken through the same `kokoro-rs`
 * route and the same decoding machinery the inbox's play button uses. A turn
 * may also carry `navigate`, which is how the conversation moves the browser.
 *
 * Four things about the shape of this component are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **The press is the gesture.** A browser weighs an autoplay policy against
 *   the click still on the stack, and every later turn is spoken without one —
 *   so `Go live` is where the `<audio>` element and the `AudioContext` are
 *   unlocked, exactly as the inbox's first press unlocks a read-all run. Until
 *   this browser has had that press, nothing is spoken, nothing navigates and
 *   nothing grabs the keyboard: the conversation may be live on another
 *   device, but this browser has not joined it.
 * - **One player for the app**, never re-keyed, so a turn that starts from a
 *   poll rather than a click still reaches an element a gesture already
 *   unlocked. Apple's media stack refuses this route outright (it is chunked
 *   with no `Content-Length`), so a failure falls back to decoding the WAV
 *   here — `speechStream.ts`, the same path the inbox takes.
 * - **The header is mounted for the life of the app**, which is the whole
 *   reason the conversation lives in it (task 857): `navigate` is the point of
 *   the feature, and a routed page would be unmounted by the navigation it
 *   just performed — cutting its own sentence off mid-word. Since task 887
 *   the panel it renders is a right-hand sidebar rather than a popup — a
 *   portal into App's slot, a sibling of the agents sidebar — but the
 *   component itself has not moved, and neither has the reason. The panel
 *   opens and closes without touching the session; only `End` ends it.
 * - **Pause is this browser's own** (task 882). Stepping out stops the run
 *   whole — no speech, no `navigate`, no sidebar fold — and shuts the
 *   microphone, while the session stays `live` and the agent keeps working;
 *   the turns pile up in the transcript and Resume performs them in order,
 *   starting with the sentence the pause cut off, from its beginning (mesa
 *   task 1161).
 *   No route, no session state: pausing a conversation is not the same event
 *   as ending one, and only one of the two is recoverable.
 * - **The capture box never takes the keyboard on its own** (mesa task 1439,
 *   `liveCapture.ts`): it has focus only when the person clicks or Tabs into
 *   it, so the whiteboard's text can be selected and copied. Dictation does
 *   not need it focused — a transcribed or recognized sentence reaches the
 *   conversation with the keyboard anywhere. The typed box is sent by Enter
 *   alone (mesa task 977) — only a *transcribed* recording is sent on mesa's
 *   own clock.
 *
 * The two page verbs — `navigate` and the sidebar pair (task 859) — are both
 * performed here, in transcript order, when the run *reaches* the turn: the
 * browser moves and the panels fold where the sentence around them said they
 * would. The hub owns neither sidebar's state (App does, for both of them and
 * for the phone tab bar), so collapsing is one call back up.
 */
/**
 * The Mesa Live mark (mesa task 872), drawn rather than typed: the toggle used
 * to carry a 💬 emoji, which rendered in whatever emoji font the platform
 * picked — its own colour, its own weight, its own size, none of them the
 * button's. This is the same vocabulary as the brand mark and the inbox's
 * transport glyphs: one flat sharp-cornered polygon in `currentColor`, so it
 * takes the toggle's cyan-when-open and its hover state for free.
 *
 * The shape is a speech container built as the brand mark's ziggurat — a
 * narrower tier standing on a wider one — with a sharp tail dropped from the
 * base: a mesa that talks. One step rather than the brand mark's three,
 * because the stepping has to survive as *silhouette* at the ~14px this
 * renders at, and three tiers there stop reading as a plateau and start
 * reading as a lump.

  //   `hearing` — "transcribing…" and the silence send's withholding — counts
  //   segments the daemon has ended and not yet answered.
  // - A `final` is the settled text, run through `holdSettled` exactly as a
  //   posted segment's transcript is.
  // - Teardown and the listen switch send `stop` rather than cutting a
  //   segment, and put one more wait on the chain — for `done` — so the
  //   switch's flush waits behind the finals the daemon still owes, exactly
  //   as `liveDrain.ts` makes it wait behind a segment in flight. Those
  //   finals are delivered whenever they land and judged by `mayHold`, so a
  //   pause and an end drop them as they drop a cut segment today.
  // - A socket that closes any other way (the daemon dying is `error` +
  //   1011 from the proxy) stops capture and asks `GET /api/live/transcribe`
  //   again, which the proxy has already invalidated, so the unavailable
  //   banner appears; the banner's Retry, not a reconnect loop, is the way
  //   back. A daemon still ready (a 1013 backlog, a 1011 decode error) moves

  // - It opens its **own** stream, with `echoCancellation`,
  //   `noiseSuppression` and `autoGainControl` all set explicitly, because
  //   the room contains mesa's own voice out of the speakers. The main
  //   stream's constraints are untouched.
  // - Its VAD is `BARGE_IN_VAD` — a shorter hangover and a 3s cap — so a
  //   phrase is transcribed a beat after its last word, and a segment that
  //   runs into the cap (a long sentence, or mesa's own reply leaking
  //   through) is dropped **untranscribed** rather than cut and continued.
  // - It does **one** thing with a transcript: `isPausePhrase` →
  //   `pauseNow()`. Anything else is dropped — never held, never sent,
  //   never `markHeard`, never the level meter, never the silence clock —
  //   because nothing heard while mesa is speaking is a recording, and the
  //   whole-short-utterance rule in `livePausePhrase.ts` is what keeps a
  //   fragment of her sentence from ever matching.
  // - Its segments transcribe in order on a run-local promise, not the
  //   component's `SegmentChain`: that chain orders the *recording*, and
  //   these segments never reach it.
  // - A microphone failure here is silent. A refusal will be reported by the

  //   will not open falls back to the default once, exactly as it does there,
  //   but with nothing to say about it.
