/**
 * The live conversation's whiteboard (mesa task 1071) — a right-hand sidebar
 * beside the conversation itself, showing the one board the agent pushed
 * last, with the history behind it a step away.
 *
 * The panel is a **reader**. There is no board write route at all: boards are
 * pushed by the CLI, which is the agent running as the person, and the close
 * button here closes exactly like the conversation panel's — a picture put
 * away is not a write. The one request it makes is the render route, and only
 * for the board being looked at: `LiveState.boards` is bodiless, so the poll
 * carries the history as pointers and a megabyte-scale body is fetched once.
 *
 * It also holds a **pen** (mesa task 1353): with the pen on, a drag draws on a
 * canvas laid over the board. The ink is this browser's own, held by the hub
 * per board id (`liveInk.ts`), and reaches the agent only as a PNG on the
 * next turn the person sends — which the hub asks this panel to flatten
 * through `flattenRef`, since only the panel can see the board's pixels. The
 * first unsent stroke freezes the layout — no resize, maximise, restore,
 * stepping, closing or scrolling — until that turn is sent or the ink cleared.
 */

/**
 * The rendered board itself, and the branch that carries the security
 * argument — `ArtifactPreview` in `pages/ArtifactsView.tsx`, deliberately
 * mirrored, because it is the same problem: agent-written markup shown to a
 * person.
 *
 * `html` needs no fetch here at all; the `<iframe>` loads the render route
 * by URL and the route streams the body server-side. Its
 * `sandbox="allow-scripts"` is a SECOND, INDEPENDENT layer over the render
 * route's own CSP header (`RENDER_CSP` in `src/api.rs`, the byte-identical
 * policy the artifact route serves): the header protects a direct navigation
 * to the URL, the attribute protects this framed case even if the header ever
 * regressed. Never add `allow-same-origin` — that hands the framed document
 * mesa's own origin, and with it mesa's storage and every mesa route, the
 * terminal and agents ones included. Never `srcDoc`, never
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: the whole point is that the body is parsed by
 * the browser as a document at an opaque origin, never injected into mesa's
 * own DOM.
 *
 * `image` and `diagram` are an `<img>`, so the bytes are never treated as
 * markup (and the pen's flatten draws the diagram back exactly where it
 * sits), and `markdown` is the one kind whose body the page fetches itself, since
 * `<Markdown>` renders text rather than loading a URL — and the one kind that
 * is safe in mesa's own DOM, because that component passes no raw HTML
 * through.
