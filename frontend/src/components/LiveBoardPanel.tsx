/**
 * The live conversation's whiteboard (mesa task 1071) — a **section** of the
 * conversation panel (mesa task 1447, folded in from a floating overlay of
 * its own) showing the one board the agent pushed last, with the history
 * behind it a step away. `LiveHub` renders this component in one fixed place
 * in the panel's tree whether or not the section is folded — see `expanded`
 * below for why it is never conditionally rendered.
 *
 * The panel is a **reader**. There is no board write route at all: boards are
 * pushed by the CLI, which is the agent running as the person, and the fold
 * button here folds exactly like the conversation panel's own close — a
 * picture put away is not a write. The one request it makes is the render
 * route, and only for the board being looked at: `LiveState.boards` is
 * bodiless, so the poll carries the history as pointers and a megabyte-scale
 * body is fetched once.
 *
 * It also holds a **pen** (mesa task 1353): with the pen on, a drag draws on a
 * canvas laid over the board. The ink is this browser's own, held by the hub
 * per board id (`liveInk.ts`), and reaches the agent only as a PNG on the
 * next turn the person sends — which the hub asks this panel to flatten
 * through `flattenRef`, since only the panel can see the board's pixels. The
 * first unsent stroke freezes the section — no maximise, restore, stepping,
 * folding or arrangement change — until that turn is sent or the ink cleared;
 * `LiveHub` pins the section's own size for the same reason, since it now
 * owns the layout this panel sits inside.
 */

/**
 * The rendered board itself, and the branch that carries the security
 * argument — `ArtifactPreview` in `pages/ArtifactsView.tsx`, deliberately
 * mirrored, because it is the same problem: agent-written markup shown to a
 * person.
 *
 * `html` needs no fetch here at all; the `<iframe>` loads the render route
 * by URL and the route streams the body server-side. Its
 * `sandbox="allow-scripts"` is a SECOND, INDEPENDENT layer over the render
 * route's own CSP header (`RENDER_CSP` in `src/api.rs`, the byte-identical
 * policy the artifact route serves): the header protects a direct navigation
 * to the URL, the attribute protects this framed case even if the header ever
 * regressed. Never add `allow-same-origin` — that hands the framed document
 * mesa's own origin, and with it mesa's storage and every mesa route, the
 * terminal and agents ones included. Never `srcDoc`, never
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: the whole point is that the body is parsed by
 * the browser as a document at an opaque origin, never injected into mesa's
 * own DOM.
 *
 * `image` and `diagram` are an `<img>`, so the bytes are never treated as
 * markup (and the pen's flatten draws the diagram back exactly where it
 * sits), and `markdown` is the one kind whose body the page fetches itself, since
 * `<Markdown>` renders text rather than loading a URL — and the one kind that
 * is safe in mesa's own DOM, because that component passes no raw HTML
 * through.
 *
 * **Exported** (mesa task 1448) so the CC session detail page's whiteboard
 * history section can render a past session's boards through the exact same
 * branch — the render route answers identically whether the session is live
 * or has ended, so there is nothing here that needs to differ. Typed on the
 * three fields it actually reads rather than `LiveBoardSummary` itself,
 * since a `LiveBoardHistoryEntry` (that history's own row shape) has them
 * too but no `session_id`.
