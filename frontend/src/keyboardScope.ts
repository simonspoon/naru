// nav) must check `shouldIgnoreShortcut` before acting on a keystroke; a
// *chord* shortcut that steals a browser binding checks its own sibling
// below, for the reason set out there.

/** A function key, F1 through F24. Rule 2 below suppresses a bare shortcut
 *  because the key would otherwise be *typed into* the focused field; a
 *  function key produces no text, so that reason does not apply to it and a
 *  shortcut rebound to one fires wherever the caret sits (mesa task 1268 — a
 *  live-listen rebound to F5 worked once, then never again, because muting
 *  hands focus back to the capture box). Only this family: Escape, the arrows,
 *  Enter, Tab and Space all have in-field meaning. */

 *    duplicate-frame, etc).
 * 2. The event target is inside a text input, textarea, contenteditable, or
 *    native <select> — typing and native select option-cycling/type-ahead.
 *    A function key is the one exception, for the reason `FUNCTION_KEY`
 *    above gives. The other is `claimedFrom`: a selector naming the one text
 *    control a caller's shortcut is still claimed from (mesa task 1354 — the
 *    live capture box for `live-cancel`'s Escape, since that box holds the
 *    keyboard for most of a conversation and Escape types nothing into it).
 *    Rules 3–5 still apply there; only this rule stands aside.
 * 3. The event target is inside an xterm terminal pane (`.xterm` or
 *    `.agent-terminal`).
 * 4. A workflow canvas is mounted anywhere on the page (`.workflow-canvas`) —
 *    it owns its own key handling and is its own spatial surface.
 * 5. A modal that owns its own key handling is open (create-task/
 *    create-project/command-palette backdrops).

 * True when a Files-tab chord (Cmd/Ctrl+F, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F, Alt+W,
 * Alt+[ / Alt+]) must let the keystroke go — to the browser's own binding, or
 * to whatever else is on screen.
 *
 * One predicate for all of them rather than one per chord: they ask nearly the
 * same question — "may the Files tab claim a chord right now?" — and two copies
 * of an answer are two things to keep in step. (It was
 * `shouldIgnoreFindShortcut` while find was the only chord; slice 4's tab
 * bindings gave it a second caller, not a second rule.) The `chord` argument is
 * the one place they part company, and it is required rather than defaulted so
 * a third caller has to say which kind it is instead of inheriting whichever
 * answer happened to be the default.
 *
 * A separate export rather than a branch of `shouldIgnoreShortcut`, because
 * that predicate's very first rule is "a modifier chord belongs to its existing
 * owner" — it answers `true` for every chord by construction, so a chord
 * shortcut cannot consult it and must not be the reason someone weakens it.
 * It lives here anyway, beside its sibling, so there is still exactly one file
 * that decides which surface may claim a keystroke; a hand-rolled check inside
 * a component is how one surface starts eating another's keys.
 *
 * Two reasons to stand down, both about *what is focused*, since the listener
 * is already scoped to a mounted, focused Files pane:
 * 1. A modal that owns its own keys is open (the shared `.create-task-backdrop`
 *    — create-task, create-project and the task detail — or the command
 *    palette). The Files tab is still mounted underneath it, and typing in a
 *    task field must never be interrupted by a find bar behind the modal.
 * 2. The caret is in a text control that is *not* the tab's own: the tree's
 *    new-file naming row, or any other field inside the tab. The editor
 *    (`.files-content-editor`) claims every one of these chords, since finding
 *    text in — or closing — the file you are editing is the whole point; which
 *    *other* boxes a chord survives is `CHORD_FIELDS` above.
 *
 * The find bar's box is where `'find'` and `'tabs'` part company, because the
 * two chords do not do the same thing to it: Cmd/Ctrl+F acts *in* that input,
 * while Alt+W and Alt+[ / ] act by tearing it down — the pane's active path
 * changes, `ContentPane` remounts and the bar is unmounted while its input holds
 * focus, which drops focus on `<body>` (Tab restarts at the top of the page,
 * Escape answers nothing). That is the precise outcome `closeFind`'s focus
 * hand-back exists to prevent, and the tab chords have nowhere to hand it: the
 * pane that would receive it does not exist yet at the moment they commit. So
 * they stand down while the caret is in the query box — a chord pressed *into* a
 * text field the user is typing in is the weaker claim of the two — and every
 * other route to those chords (the code editor, the file, the strip) is
 * untouched.
