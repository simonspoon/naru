/**
 * Pure decisions for the Library page's item list: folding a user row and the
 * built-in it shadows by *name* into one row, and diffing the two bodies.
 *
 * `core::library::effective_items` shadows a built-in only through a db row's
 * `builtin_id` — a fork. A row that merely collides by `(kind, scope, name)`
 * (one adopted from disk by a sync, say) leaves both in the list, and the file
 * on disk can only ever be one of them. That pair is what `foldOverrides`
 * folds: the built-in is dropped and the user row says it overrides one.
 *
 * `diffLines` is a **deliberate second implementation** of
 * `core::library::diff_lines` (`src/core/library.rs`). Both bodies are already
 * in the browser — they arrive on the list `GET /api/library` makes — so
 * asking the server would mean a new gated route for data the page holds, to
 * answer a question that is pure text. The two implementations must stay in
 * step: same line-splitting semantics, the same tie-break, and the same two
 * bounds degrading to the same marker line. Change one, change the other.
