// Persisted width of the left nav sidebar (mesa task 665), the mirror of the
// agent sidebar's own drag-resize. Machine-local (localStorage), like
// `lastFolder.ts` and the workflow view state: it is a per-browser
// preference about this one screen, never project or server data, so it has
// no column, no route and no place in a backup.
//
// The clamp lives here rather than in the component because a stored value is
// as untrusted as a mid-drag pointer position — a hand-edited key, a value
// written on a 2560px monitor and reloaded on a 1280px laptop, or a stale
// entry from before the floor changed all have to resolve to something the
// shell can render. Every path out of this module (load and clamp alike)
// returns a number in range or the default; the component never holds an
// out-of-range width, it doesn't merely render one.
