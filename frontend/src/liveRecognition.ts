/**
 * The browser's own ears (mesa task 873).
 *
 * Until now the live conversation heard the person only through *system*
 * dictation typing into the capture box: the box had to hold the keyboard, a
 * click elsewhere broke it, and a settled draft was sent on a timer. This
 * module is the other way in — the Web Speech API, opened in the page, posting
 * each **final** result as a `user` turn the moment the engine settles it.
 *
 * Three things about the shape of it are load-bearing, and all three are
 * decisions rather than plumbing, which is why they live here and not in
 * `LiveHub.tsx`:
 *
 * - **Only a final result is recorded.** An interim result is the engine
 *   thinking out loud — it is shown as a preview and never recorded, because a
 *   sentence held mid-guess is a sentence the person never said.
 * - **Listening is a recording, not a stream of utterances** (mesa task 889),
 *   and a recording has **two** boundaries, not one (mesa task 917). Each
 *   settled sentence is *held* rather than sent, and the whole recording
 *   becomes **one** `user` turn — ordinarily on **silence**: the wait
 *   `live.auto-send-ms` names. `liveCapture.ts::autoSendIdleMs` still owns
 *   the number and the clamp; mesa task 977 took the typed box off it, so
 *   this is now that setting's one reader rather than one of two. A
 *   conversation is not one sentence at a time: the engine settles
 *   wherever the speaker drew breath, so posting each final made the agent
 *   answer a half-thought and then answer the rest of it, and the person had
 *   to talk to the pauses the engine chose rather than to mesa — silence
 *   after the *whole* thought is the pause that actually means something. The
 *   switch the person already has (the `live-listen` chord in `keymap.ts`,
 *   the listen button)
 *   remains the second boundary: an explicit early send for whenever the
 *   silence wait would be too slow or too fast for what was just said. The
 *   silence timer is measured on `shouldListen`, not `recognizesSpeech` —
 *   deliberately excluding the seconds mesa is talking, because a timer that
 *   ran through her reply would read the person's own silence, sitting and
 *   listening to mesa, as them falling quiet, and post the half-thought she
 *   is still mid-reply to. It also restarts on every result, interim included,
 *   so a mid-sentence pause the person fills back in does not get cut off by
 *   a clock that only heard the settled words.
 * - **Recognition ends on its own, constantly.** Chrome stops after roughly a
 *   minute, and on a long enough silence; the engine reports that as an
 *   ordinary end, not an error. So "should it be running" is asked again on
 *   every end (`shouldListen`) rather than assumed from the last start, and the
 *   answer is what restarts it.
 * - **mesa stops listening while she speaks.** The microphone would otherwise
 *   hear her own reply out of the speakers and answer it — a conversation with
 *   itself. `speaking` is therefore a gate on listening, not a separate mute.
 *
 * As of mesa task 956, `LiveHub.tsx` no longer calls into this module for the
 * microphone itself — page-side audio capture (`liveAudio.ts`, `liveVad.ts`)
 * posts each finished utterance to `POST /api/live/transcribe`, which hands
 * it to the external `auris` binary and returns text. That text is handed
 * straight to the functions below, at exactly the point in the flow
 * `onresult`'s final branch used to occupy — `heldWith`, `shouldFlushSilence`,
 * `heldFlush`, `utteranceFrom`, `captureHint`, `correctVocabulary` and the
 * rest of this module's exports are all still in use, unchanged, because the
 * decisions they encode (only a settled utterance is recorded, a recording
 * has two boundaries, the person's own vocabulary gets corrected) never had
 * anything to do with *how* the words were heard. `recognitionCtor`,
 * `readResults`, `isBlockingError` and `SpeechRecognitionLike` are the part
 * that was `SpeechRecognition`-specific; as of mesa task 957 they are **in
 * use again**, by the browser-recognizer path `listenPath` falls back to on
 * a machine with no `auris`.

 * `paused`: muting stops mesa hearing this room while she keeps talking and

/**
 * A rough phonetic fold, used to catch the browser mishearing a name mesa
 * knows for an ordinary word that sounds like it (mesa task 922) — "khora" as
 * "chorus", "helios" as "helius". `SpeechGrammarList`, the API's own way to
 * hand a recognizer a vocabulary up front, is a documented no-op in Chrome, so
 * this correction has to happen after the fact, on the text the engine already
 * settled on.
 *
 * Plain soundex will not do: it keeps the first *letter* rather than the first
 * *sound*, so "chorus" (C-) and "khora" (K-) are already different codes
 * before either word is folded any further. Metaphone comes closer but maps
 * `ch` to `x`, landing "chorus" and "khora" on different codes again. This
 * fold instead normalises the *spelling* toward the sound first — `ch`, `kh`,
 * `ck` and `qu` all become `k`, the same target `c` itself falls to except
 * before `e`/`i`/`y` — and only then keeps one representative letter, so both
 * words collapse onto the same key.
 *
 * The steps, in the order that makes that collapse happen:
 * 1. Lowercase and strip everything that is not a-z — punctuation and
 *    digits carry no sound.
 * 2. Fold digraphs and single letters that spell one sound multiple ways,
 *    left to right over the whole string. `gh` is dropped outright (a silent
 *    letter pair in the words it appears in, "though"/"through"/"ghost"'s `h`
 *    contribute nothing to how the name sounds); `x` becomes `ks` and `z`
 *    becomes `s` because both are just voiced/voiceless spellings of sounds
 *    already in the alphabet; `y` is left as a vowel rather than folded, so
 *    the vowel-stripping step below treats it exactly like `a`/`e`/`i`/`o`/`u`.
 *    This has to run before step 4, or `ch`/`kh`/`ck` would already have lost
 *    the letter that makes them a digraph.
 * 3. Drop one trailing `s` — the recognizer's stray plural/sibilant
 *    ("helius" for "Helios") must not be what keeps two spellings apart.
 * 4. Keep the first character verbatim (soundex's one idea worth keeping —
 *    two words starting on genuinely different sounds should stay apart), then
 *    drop every vowel *after* it. Vowels are the least reliably heard part of
 *    a word and the part speakers vary most on, so keeping only the
 *    consonant skeleton is what makes "khora" and "chorus" line up despite
 *    neither vowel matching.
 * 5. Collapse runs of the same character to one, the way soundex does for a
 *    doubled consonant — "kh" and "k" folding to the same letter in step 2
 *    can otherwise leave "kk" where a single word only ever had one sound.
 *
 * Worked examples this order is chosen to satisfy (both sides fold to `kr`,
 * `hls`, `hlm` respectively — the exact letters are incidental, only the
 * equalities below are load-bearing and are what the tests check):
 * - `soundKey('chorus') === soundKey('khora')`
 * - `soundKey('helius') === soundKey('helios')`
 * - `soundKey('helium') !== soundKey('helios')`

 *
 * - Each name is split on whitespace and punctuation into tokens, and each
 *   token stands as its own candidate — a two-word project name should
 *   correct either of its words on its own, not only the phrase whole.
 * - A token under 4 characters is dropped: a short sound key is a common
 *   prefix of half the language, so "correcting" toward it would rewrite far
 *   more ordinary speech than it would ever fix.
 * - A token whose *sound key* comes out under 2 characters is dropped for the
 *   same reason, one step later — the fold can shrink a longer token down to
 *   almost nothing (a name that is mostly vowels), and it is the key's length
 *   that actually determines how much it collides with.
 * - A token that is itself in `COMMON_ENGLISH` is dropped: a name that is
 *   also an everyday word cannot be corrected *to* without corrupting the
 *   ordinary speech that already spells it that way.
 * - If two different surviving tokens land on the same sound key with
 *   *different* canonical spellings, the key is dropped entirely rather than
 *   arbitrarily keeping one — mesa has no way to know which of two real names
 *   the person meant, and guessing wrong is the exact failure this feature
 *   exists to avoid.
 * - The key is computed from the lowercased token; the value kept is the
 *   token's original spelling, so a proper-noun capitalisation in a project
