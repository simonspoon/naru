/**
 * The whiteboard's arithmetic (mesa task 1071) — what the panel is showing,
 * and where its one body is fetched from.
 *
 * A board is a **picture pushed by the agent**, and `GET /api/live` carries
 * the whole history as bodiless summaries: the bodies are megabyte-scale
 * documents, so the poll answers with pointers and exactly one of them is
 * ever fetched, by the render route, for the board being looked at. The two
 * decisions that follow from that — which board is showing, and how its body
 * reaches the screen — are the kind that has historically shipped wrong in a
 * `.tsx`, so they live here beside a test and `LiveBoardPanel.tsx` only
 * performs them (`liveTurns.ts`, same reason). The render route's own URL is
 * not one of them: it is `api.ts::liveBoardRenderUrl`, beside every other URL
 * this app builds.
 *
 * The rule the stepper exists to hold is that **each push replaces what is
 * showing**. A board is a snapshot, not a document with a history: the person
 * may step back through what has already been pushed, but the moment the
 * agent pushes a new one it is what the conversation is talking about, and
 * leaving the panel on an old board would be showing the person a picture
 * nobody is discussing.

 * rendered in mesa's own DOM at all (`components/Markdown.tsx` passes no raw
 * HTML through). `image` is an `<img>`, so the browser never treats the
 * bytes as markup — and so is a `diagram` (mesa task 1353): its SVG is a
 * static picture Naru rendered, an `<img>` runs no script in it at all, and
 * it lays the picture out exactly as the pen's flatten draws it back, which
 * a framed document's own layout does not promise. Everything else is a
 * frame: an unknown kind arriving from a newer server must land on the
 * *safest* branch, not the most permissive one, so `frame` is the default

 * cleared** arrives as an empty list and resets the view whole — including
 * `seen`, so the next board is a push rather than something already
 * accounted for. And a **different session** needs nothing either: board ids
