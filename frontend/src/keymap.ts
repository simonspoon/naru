 *
 * Before this module each listener compared `e.key` inline — the palette in
 * `App.tsx`, the spatial nav's `KEY_DIRECTION`, the `a` shortcut in
 * `ProjectTasksPage`, the listen chord in `liveRecognition.ts` — so there was
 * nowhere to *state* what mesa binds, and nothing to rebind. Every one of them
 * now asks `matchesShortcut` instead, which is what lets the Settings page's
 * Keyboard shortcuts section and the command palette's key caps read the same
 * answer the listeners act on.
 *
 * Only the global **window** listeners are here. The Files tab's chords,
 * the code editor's Cmd/Ctrl+S and a modal's Escape stay hard-coded on
 * purpose: each belongs to one surface that is on screen and owns the keyboard
 * while it is, which is a different thing from a binding the whole app answers
 * to. Rebinding those would mean rebinding a form, not the app.

 * from inside a text field, as the palette does) or the palette to `p` (which
 * must not be typed into one).
 *
 * `shouldIgnoreShortcut`'s own first rule — "a modifier chord belongs to its
