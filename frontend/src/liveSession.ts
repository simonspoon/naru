 * "listening" while the last call failed is the one way this line can lie —
 * and a live session with no agent bound is called out, because it will listen
 * for ever and never answer.
 *
 * `paused` sits directly under the two not-live states and above everything
 * else the running conversation could say. It has to: while paused nothing is
 * spoken and the microphone is shut, so "Speaking…" and "Listening." are both
 * simply untrue, and even the no-agent warning is the wrong thing to lead with
 * when the reason nothing is happening is that the person asked for it. It
 * ranks *below* the not-live pair because those describe the session itself,
 * which pause never touches.
 *
 * `resting_since` (mesa task 1155) comes after speaking — a spoken reply
 * that outlives the handoff is still sounding — and before the no-agent
 * warning, since a resting session has a successor bound and the reason
 * nothing answers is the rest, not a missing agent.
 *
 * `unavailable` (the page's `ListenPath` is `'unavailable'`, mesa task 1390)
 * replaces only the last arm: the banner says the speech server is not
 * ready, so this line must not claim to be listening.
