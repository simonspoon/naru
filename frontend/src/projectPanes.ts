// The project page's "Custom" tab (mesa task 843): the pane tree a user builds
// by dragging view tabs (Dashboard, Board, Workflows, …) into the main area,
// plus the machine-local memory that keeps it across navigations.
//
// Two deliberate shapes:
// - **A view appears at most once.** A leaf's id *is* its tab name, so dragging
//   an already-open view somewhere else moves that pane rather than opening a
//   second copy of it — which is also what lets every gesture here reuse
//   `lib/paneTree.ts` unchanged (that engine keys only off opaque leaf ids).
// - **The drop itself is `resolveDrop`.** A tab dragged from the strip is
//   appended to the tree and then dropped exactly like an existing pane would
//   be, so the edge/center zones, the split orientation and the canonicalization
//   all match the Terminal page and the Agent sidebar instead of re-deriving a
//   second interaction model.
//
// Persistence is localStorage, keyed by project — machine-local, like
// lastView.ts and lastFolder.ts, never project or server data.
