/** How many *live* Claude Code sessions look like they are working on this
 * task — what drives the kanban card's live marker (mesa task 663).
 *
 * The link is by session name: both watchers spawn with
 * `format!("{}: {}", project.name, task.name)` (`src/api.rs`), and the
 * frontend holds both halves, so it reconstructs that exact string and
 * compares. Liveness is the existing `isRunningAgent` — the one predicate,
 * shared with the Agents sidebar.
 *
 * **This is deliberately best-effort, and a decoration only.** There is no
 * stored task↔session link (no column, no migration, no route), so the match
 * lapses silently in several ordinary cases and must always degrade to "no
 * animation":
 * - sessions started from the Agents sidebar's "add agent" button carry no
 *   `--name` at all (`DEFAULT_AGENT_SPAWN` has no `{name}`) and never match;
 * - a user-replaced `todo-watcher` command template that
 *   drops `{name}` loses the animation and nothing else;
 * - if a task's `description` (and so its derived `name`) changed after
 *   dispatch, the match lapses;
 * - two tasks in one project whose first 50 chars are identical share a
 *   derived `name`, so both animate.
 *
 * `projectName`/`sessions` are nullable so the not-yet-loaded and
 * failed-fetch cases (`/api/agents` is gated and 502s with no `claude`
 * binary) are the same "0" as no match. */
