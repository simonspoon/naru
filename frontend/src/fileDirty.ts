//
// Same reason `fileTabs.ts` exists (CLAUDE.md): "is this tab dirty" and "would
// closing it throw work away" are predicates, and a predicate that decides
// whether the app warns you is exactly the kind that historically ships wrong —
// so it lives where vitest can reach it rather than inline in `FilesView.tsx`.
// The `.tsx` keeps the state and the DOM; every question this file names is
// answered here.
//
// It deliberately owns no state of its own. `FilesView` already keeps one
// `FileUiState` per open path and already drops it when the last tab for that
// path closes; this module reads that map, it does not duplicate it.

 *
 * `baseline` is the file's bytes as they were when editing started (and as
 * they are again after a successful save). Comparing against it rather than
 * against the live fetched content is what makes this answerable *outside* the
 * mounted pane: only `ContentPane` has the response in hand, and the tab strip

 * already said to leave. Which way out it was is not observable afterwards:
 * `FilesView`'s `startEdit` is the only writer of `editing: true` and it
 * re-reads the file on every entry, so the next edit starts from disk whatever
 * the last one left in `draft`.
