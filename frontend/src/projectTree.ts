// Tree assembly for the left nav's nested project list (mesa task 668).
//
// The server never sends a tree: `GET /api/projects` is one FLAT array in
// `ORDER BY sort_order, id`, and `parent_id` is just a field on each row. That
// is deliberate — order stays server-side and the CLI, the API and the nav
// cannot disagree — so the shape the sidebar draws has to be derived here.
//
// It lives in a module rather than inline in `Sidebar.tsx` for the reason
// CLAUDE.md gives: these are the predicates that historically ship wrong (a
// child whose parent was filtered out of the array; a malformed cycle looping
// forever; a rolled-up count that double-counts), and they belong somewhere
// vitest can reach.

 * - **An absent parent means top level.** The sidebar renders the active list
 *   and the archived group from partitions of one fetch, so a live child of an
 *   archived parent arrives with a `parent_id` no row in *this* array has.
 *   It renders at depth 0 rather than disappearing — a project that exists
 *   must always be reachable from the nav.
 * - **A cycle cannot hang.** `parent_id` cycles are rejected by `Store`, but a
 *   hand-edited db or a future bug must not spin the render loop: anything not
 *   reached from a root is appended at top level, so every input row comes out
