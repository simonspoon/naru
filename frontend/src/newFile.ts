/**
 * Naming a new file in the Files tab (mesa task 672): the one decision the
 * create affordance makes before it touches the network — does this typed name
 * become a relative path, or an inline message?
 *
 * A pure module rather than a handful of `if`s inside `FilesView.tsx`, for the
 * same reason `navOrder`/`fileTabs` are (CLAUDE.md): this is exactly the kind
 * of predicate that ships wrong, and a component isn't where it can be tested.
 *
 * The rules mirror `core::files::create_file`'s single-component checks, but
 * the SERVER stays authoritative — this copy exists to turn an obviously bad
 * name into an instant message instead of a round trip, never to be the
 * boundary. Anything it lets through the server still re-validates.
