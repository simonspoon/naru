/**
 * Playing one of mesa's speak routes on a browser whose media stack will not
 * (mesa task 830) — the inbox's item route, or the live page's turn route.
 *
 * Apple's requires byte-range support of an HTTP media source, and these routes
 * are chunked with no `Content-Length` because the render is still happening —
 * so `<audio src>` there fails outright (task 829) and the first fix was to
 * fetch the audio whole, which meant waiting for the last sentence. The page
 * can instead decode the bytes itself: `fetch` streams the body, `wavStream`
 * turns each chunk into samples, and each one is scheduled on the Web Audio
 * clock as it lands. No range request is ever involved, so nothing about the
 * route has to change and the first sentence still starts in a couple of
 * seconds.
 *
 * The `AudioContext` is the caller's, created and resumed inside the press:
 * the gesture is what unlocks audio, and the failure that sends a press down
 * this path arrives from the element *after* the gesture is gone.
 *
 * The synthesiser writes at roughly real time and its first chunk carries
 * under a tenth of a second (mesa task 1146), so decoded audio is **held**
 * rather than scheduled as it lands: nothing sounds until `PREBUFFER_SECONDS`
 * of it is queued or the body has ended, and an underrun — every scheduled
 * source ended with the body still open — goes back to holding on the same
 * terms rather than starting on the next single chunk with a lead of a few
 * hundred milliseconds. Neither ends the item; only the body's end does, once
 * the last of what it sent has been heard, and what was held at that moment
 * is scheduled and played out first. A body that stops arriving altogether —
 * a hung synthesiser — is given up on after `STALL_SECONDS` and treated as
 * ended, so a turn that never closes cannot wedge the live queue behind it.
 * The listener hears a longer first wait and, on a stall, a gap; never a
 * sample dropped and never a turn cut short.
 *
 * The speech speed (mesa task 1560) is applied here by time-stretching the
 * decoded samples — `timeStretch.ts`, pitch-preserving, stateful across
 * chunks — read once when the item starts. Every buffer on the clock is
 * already the stretched audio, so `duration` and the rewind arithmetic need
 * no knowledge of it; at 1x the stretcher is an exact passthrough.
 *
 * What lives here is the imperative half — a fetch, a clock, and scheduled
 * source nodes. The arithmetic worth pinning is in `speechPlayback.ts`.
