 * the page header, where it had to answer for a conversation whose panel was
 * usually shut. The head is where both belong once the panel is the surface
 * the person is actually looking at: the aperture, a word for what is
 * happening, how loud the room is, and how long this has been going on.
 *
 * Everything here is presentation, and deliberately pure — the ranking below
 * is the same one `liveIndicator.ts` and `liveStatusLine` already make, said
 * in one word instead of a drawing or a sentence, and the two clocks are
 * arithmetic the component would otherwise do inline in JSX.

 * - **A conversation that is not running comes next**, for `liveStatusLine`'s

 * - **mesa speaking, then paused, then hearing** — `headerIndicator`'s
 *   ranking exactly, including why speaking sits above paused (a tail of
 *   audio still sounding is audio) and why paused sits above hearing (a draft
 *   left in the box from before the pause is not the person still talking).
