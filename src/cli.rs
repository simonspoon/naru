OUTPUT
  Every command prints JSON to stdout: by default mutations and `show` print
  the full object, `list` prints a bare JSON array, `delete` prints the full
  deleted record(s) so the transcript is a recoverable record. Every task
  object always carries a boolean `blocked` field (true if any dependency is
  not done/cancelled).

  --quiet (opt-in, long form only; no -q) prints the COMPACT projection
  instead — the record minus its unbounded free-text fields; for a task that
  is exactly the bounded shape `task list` already emits. Accepted on every
  mutation and `show`/`get` in `project`, `task`, `workflow` (+ `node`,
  `edge`), `inbox`, `script`, `artifact` and `live`; composite payloads keep their key structure and
  compact their members. It changes stdout only — never exit codes, stderr or
  stored data — and default output is byte-identical to before the flag
  existed. On a `delete` it waives the full echo, which is mesa's recovery
  transcript standing in for the absent confirmation prompt: allowed because
  you asked, never a default.
  `mesa task update <id> --quiet` with no field flag is still a usage error
  (exit 2) — `--quiet` sits outside the required field group.

  Errors are JSON on stderr:
    {\"error\": {\"code\": \"not_found|cycle|validation|conflict|usage|unavailable\", \"message\": \"...\"}}
  Exit codes: 0 success, 1 domain/runtime error, 2 usage error. `unavailable`
  is scoped to the commands that depend on something outside mesa:
  `cc usage` (missing token or unreachable upstream), `task execute` (the
  hook shell could not be started), `live start` (the `claude` binary that
  drives the conversation could not be started) and `live look` (the `loki`
  desktop tool, or the browser window it was asked to photograph) and
  `notify` (the `vox` CLI, or its Telegram setup).

DATABASE
  Defaults to ~/Library/Application Support/naru/naru.db; an install from
  before the rename keeps using .../mesa/mesa.db while no naru.db exists.
  Override with NARU_DB=<path> (MESA_DB=<path> is still honoured).

EXAMPLES
  mesa project create \"Website redesign\" --description \"Q3 marketing site\"
  mesa task create --project 1 --description \"Draft homepage copy\" --tags writing,web
  mesa task list --project 1 --status todo --unblocked
  mesa task block 3 --by 1        # task 3 is blocked by task 1
  mesa backup /tmp/mesa-snap.db

By default the current directory's git repo (or the --path directory's, when
given) is bound to the new project via its root (first) commit hash, so every
clone/worktree of the same source later resolves here (see `mesa project
resolve`). Binding a commit already held by another project fails with
`conflict`. Use --no-git to skip, or --root-commit to bind an explicit hash
instead of detecting it.")]
