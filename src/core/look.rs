//! Photographing the browser window a live conversation is being held in
//! (mesa task 895), with the external `loki` desktop-automation binary.
//!
//! The agent driving a live conversation is otherwise **blind**. It knows the
//! `route` the person is on and the `context` open on it, and neither of those
//! is what actually rendered — so "does this look right?" can only be answered
//! by asking the person to describe their own screen. `mesa live look` answers
//! it directly: it screenshots the window and prints a path the agent opens
//! with its image tool.
//!
//! The whole design problem is **which window**. Several headless browsers on
//! a developer's machine report a window titled `mesa`, so a title match would
//! photograph one of those. A window's position and size together are its
//! identity instead: the page reports its own
//! `screenX`/`screenY`/`outerWidth`/`outerHeight` on the poll it already makes
//! (`Store::set_live_route`), `loki` reports every window's frame in the same
//! screen coordinates, and the two match exactly. Only the browser that is
//! *joined to the conversation* ever reports a box, so a headless window can
//! never be the one that is looked at.
//!
//! Like every other shell-out in `core` (`git.rs`, `speech.rs`, `hooks.rs`),
//! loki is invoked as **argv** — never through a shell — and it is never a
//! hard requirement: a machine with no loki installed holds ordinary
//! conversations, one command short.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no `/api/live/look` route**. This captures the
//! person's screen, and `serve --lan` offers the API to every device on the
//! network with no auth at all; no gate in this codebase makes "photograph the
//! owner's desktop" an acceptable thing to expose over HTTP. It is a CLI
//! command, reachable only by something already running as the person.
