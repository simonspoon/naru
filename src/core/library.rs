//! The library's built-ins, disk layout and sync decision table (mesa task
//! 919), plus the portable import/export bundle (mesa task 963).
//!
//! A library row is an agent definition, a skill, a hook script, a prompt,
//! or a CLAUDE.md — stored in `library_items` (`Store`) and mirrored onto a
//! file under `.claude/` (or a repo's root `CLAUDE.md`); a prompt only when
//! its `export_command` flag says it is also a slash command (mesa task 1139,
//! which folded the old `command` kind into `prompt`). This module holds
//! everything that does not touch the database: the built-in catalogue
//! (`BUILTINS`), the pure mapping from a row to its path (`relative_path`),
//! the traversal chokepoint that keeps a resolved path under its scope base
//! (`resolve`, the `files.rs::safe_path()` line held a second time), the sync
//! decision table (`classify`), and the disk-side scan a sync compares
//! against (`scan_disk`) — and, alongside those, [`export`]/[`import`], which
//! turn a library's contents into a portable [`crate::core::types::LibraryBundle`]
//! and back, for moving them to another mesa instance.
