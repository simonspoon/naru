//! The `task-stop-guard` hook (mesa task 1190) — a Claude Code `Stop` hook
//! that keeps a *task agent* from ending its turn before the mesa task it
//! was dispatched for is really handled: still `in_progress` with nothing
//! running in the background and no question filed, or closed while a
//! background shell or agent it launched is still alive.
//!
//! The shape mirrors [`crate::core::supervisor`]: one const holding the
//! script, one holding the library built-in's id, and the built-in row in
//! `core::library::BUILTINS` pointing at both. Being a [`LibraryKind::Hook`]
//! (`crate::core::types::LibraryKind::Hook`) it has a real path,
//! `.claude/hooks/task-stop-guard.sh`, and is installed by the ordinary
//! registration flow — `mesa library hook enable task-stop-guard --event
//! Stop` seeds the file and writes `~/.claude/settings.json`
//! (`docs/library.md`). Nothing in Rust runs it; the script is the whole
//! feature, and `scripts/stop-guard-check.sh` is its behavioural gate.

/// The library built-in holding [`STOP_GUARD_HOOK`]. A hook's *name* carries
/// its own extension (mesa task 1114), so the row's name is
/// [`STOP_GUARD_HOOK_NAME`] while its id stays the bare word.

/// from the session transcript plus `naru task show`/`naru inbox list`
/// whether the agent may end its turn. It needs only `bash`, `jq` and `naru`
/// and it **never wedges a session**: a missing tool, an unreadable
/// transcript, a session that is not a task agent's, or any naru error is an
/// allow (exit 0, nothing printed). A block is `{"decision":"block",
/// "reason":…}` on stdout, still exit 0.
///
/// The transcript records it reads (verified against real transcripts under
/// `~/.claude/projects/`):
///
/// * the task id — the FIRST user message, as `/execute-naru-task <id>`
///   (`DEFAULT_TASK_EXECUTE`), a slash command recorded as
///   `<command-name>/execute-naru-task</command-name>` +
///   `<command-args><id></command-args>`, or — only in a session launched
///   with `--agent`, marked by a `{"type":"agent-setting","agentSetting":…}`
///   header record no interactive session carries — a one-line prompt
///   ending in `task: <id>` (a customised template);
/// * a background shell — a `tool_result` reading `Command running in
///   background with ID: <id>`; a background agent — a `tool_result` reading
///   `Async agent launched successfully… agentId: <id>`;
/// * a close — a `<task-notification>` with that `<task-id>` (any status;
///   the same agent can notify more than once), whether it arrived as a
///   user record or was absorbed mid-turn into a `queue-operation` record's
///   `content` / a `queued_command` attachment's `prompt`; a

#   in_progress, background work pending        -> allow (the harness wakes it)
#   in_progress, nothing pending, no inbox item -> block: keep going, close it,
#                                                  park it, or file the question
