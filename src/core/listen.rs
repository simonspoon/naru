//! Transcribing recorded audio with the external `auris` speech-to-text
//! binary. This is the mirror of `speech.rs` — `speech.rs` turns mesa text
//! into audio for a browser to play; this turns audio a browser recorded
//! into text mesa can use — and it copies that module's shape closely: a
//! subprocess, not storage, invoked as argv with all three pipes drained for
//! the child's whole life. On `audio.engine = "naru-audio"` (mesa task 1389)
//! no subprocess runs: [`transcribe`] posts the recording to the daemon's
//! `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and [`models`] reads its list.
//!
//! Unlike `speech::start`, this does **not** stream a channel back to the
//! caller. `speech::start` blocks only until the WAV header is in hand
//! because audio is elastic — a minute-long render is worth starting to
//! play after a couple of seconds. A transcript is the opposite shape: one
//! short string, produced only once the whole recording has been decoded, so
//! there is nothing earlier to hand back and nothing to gain from a channel.
//! [`transcribe`] collects the whole answer and returns it.
//!
//! **Nothing here is retained** (`docs/listen.md`, mesa task 930): the audio
//! is transcribed and dropped. It is never written to `live_turns` (which has
//! no column for it), never written to disk, and never logged — the speak
//! routes' "nothing is stored and nothing is cached" read backwards, with the
//! arrow of what goes in and what comes out reversed.
