//! User config: the hook mesa runs when it starts a coding agent, and the
//! per-model price table the CC Dashboard estimates cost from.
//!
//! mesa spawns an agent from exactly six places — the todo-watcher's
//! dispatch, the inbox-watcher's triage, the Agents surface's "add agent"
//! button, the live conversation's agent, the short-lived agent that
//! writes a live conversation's memory once it ends (mesa task 921), and the
//! dream pass that tidies the live notebook between conversations (mesa task
//! 1152). Each used to be a hardcoded `claude --bg …` argv, so swapping the
//! binary, the persona, or the slash command meant a rebuild. Each is now a
//! **hook** in `~/.mesa/config.json`:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "commands": {
//!     "todo-watcher":   "claude --bg --agent supervisor --name {name} -- \"/execute-mesa-task {id}\"",
//!     "inbox-watcher":  "claude --bg --agent inbox-triage --name {name} -- \"Triage mesa inbox item {id}.\"",
//!     "agent-spawn":    "claude --bg --model opus --agent supervisor -- {prompt}",
//!     "live-agent":     "claude --bg --agent naru-live --name {name} -- {prompt}",
//!     "live-summary":   "claude --bg --name {name} -- {prompt}",
//!     "live-dream":     "claude --bg --name {name} -- {prompt}"
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## One mode: every hook is a bash script
//!
//! A value is a **bash script**, run as `bash -c <script>` (mesa task 1143).
//! One line or many — there is no second mode, no newline rule, and a
//! one-line value is simply a one-line script, which is why the defaults
//! above read as the command lines they are and why `cd`, `export`, a pipe
//! or a conditional binary all just work.
//!
//! Each `{placeholder}` is replaced, at the slot it occupies, by its **value
//! shell-quoted for the context it sits in** ([`substitute_script`],
//! [`Ctx::quoted`]): single-quoted in a word position, backslash-escaped
//! inside `"…"` and in an unquoted heredoc body. What bash reads at every slot
//! is therefore a string literal, never syntax — the watchers pass a task
//! name or an inbox body (untrusted free text) as the session `--name`, and a
//! name of `"; rm -rf / #` becomes `'"; rm -rf / #'`, one argument. Wherever
//! bash performs word expansion it does not re-read the result looking for
//! syntax, so a value inside a quoted literal cannot run. There are no
//! `MESA_*` environment variables any more (a saved script that still reads
//! one is migrated on read, [`migrate_env_references`], and refused on save);
//! an absent value is the empty string, since free-form shell text has no
//! token to drop.
//!
//! **Arithmetic evaluation is a second parser** and is the exception.
//! `$(( ))`, `(( ))`, `let "…"`, `[[ x -gt y ]]` and an array subscript all
//! re-read what they are given, and an array subscript inside arithmetic is
//! itself expanded, so `a[$(cmd)]` runs the command however it was quoted on
//! the way in. [`scan_script`] refuses the two spellings it can cheaply see
//! (`$((`, `((`), wherever they are on the context stack; the rest are
//! documented sharp edges in `docs/config.md`, because teaching this lexer
//! bash's arithmetic is a trap.
//!
//! [`scan_script`] is a deliberately coarse lexer, and it is worth being
//! precise about what its mistakes cost now that it decides the bytes bash
//! sees. Every form it emits is inert in every context that expands anything,
//! so a mis-classified context costs a *mangled value* — a single-quoted
//! string read where bash wanted double-quote escaping has stray quote
//! characters in it; an escaped one read as a bare word splits on spaces —
//! never execution. The two contexts where a wrong guess *could* reach
//! execution are not guessed at: the single-quote family (`'…'`, `$'…'`, a
//! quoted heredoc delimiter), where a `'` in the value would close the run,
//! is refused at save time, as is a `` `…` `` (write `$(…)`) and arithmetic.
//! So the lexer is still not asked to be a full bash grammar; it is asked to
//! tell those contexts apart, and the tests pin the shapes a security review
//! once broke an earlier value-substituting draft with.
//!
//! Unlike `hooks.json` (a genuine `sh -c` string, [`crate::core::hooks`]) no
//! value mesa holds ever reaches a shell unquoted.
//!
//! ## Pricing
//!
//! A second, independent section prices model families for the CC Dashboard's
//! cost estimate (mesa task 692):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "pricing": { "claude-opus": {"input": 5.0, "output": 25.0,
//!                                "cache_read": 0.5, "cache_write": 6.25} } }
//! ```
//!
//! Keys are model-family **prefixes** (`starts_with`), values USD per 1M
//! tokens. [`DEFAULT_PRICES`] ships the families mesa knows; the config
//! overlays them and may add prefixes the binary has never heard of, which is
//! the point — a new model family gets priced without a rebuild. See
//! [`PriceTable`].
//!
//! ## Watchers
//!
//! A third, equally independent section tunes the watchers (mesa task 777):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "watchers": { "todo-concurrency": 3 } }
//! ```
//!
//! Two keys: how many agents `serve --watch-todo` may have running **per
//! project** ([`todo_concurrency`]), default [`DEFAULT_TODO_CONCURRENCY`],
//! and how many hours `serve --watch-retro` waits between two
//! retrospectives ([`retro_interval_hours`], mesa task 1158), default
//! [`DEFAULT_RETRO_INTERVAL_HOURS`]. Both read per tick rather than at
//! startup, so an edit lands on the next tick with no restart. See
//! `docs/todo-watcher.md` and `docs/retro.md`.

//!
//! ## Speech
//!
//! A fourth section picks the voice the inbox's play button speaks in (mesa
//! task 822):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "speech": { "voice": "bm_george" } }
//! ```
//!
//! One key, [`VOICE`], read on every press. Absent or blank is **not** a
//! default mesa names: it means no `-v` is passed at all, so the synthesiser's
//! own default applies and an unconfigured install runs the argv it ran before
//! this setting existed. See [`speech_voice`] and `docs/inbox.md`.
//!
//! ## Live
//!
//! A fifth section holds how long a settled dictation draft waits before the
//! page sends it (mesa task 886):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "live": { "auto-send-ms": 2000 } }
//! ```
//!
//! One key, [`LIVE_AUTO_SEND_MS`]. Absent or `null` is the wait mesa ships
//! ([`DEFAULT_LIVE_AUTO_SEND_MS`]). The instruction block a live
//! conversation's agent is spawned with **used to** live here too
//! (`live.prompt`) but moved to the library as of mesa task 919 — it is now
//! the `naru-live` agent definition in the library (mesa task 1068 turned it
//! from a `prompt` into a real agent definition). A `live.prompt` key left
//! behind in a
//! hand-edited file is silently ignored: `LiveSection` simply has no field
//! for it any more. See `docs/live.md`.
//!
//! ## Listen
//!
//! A sixth, independent section names the model `live transcribe` runs the
//! external `auris` speech-to-text binary with (mesa task 955) — the input-side
//! mirror of Speech, above:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "listen": { "model": "parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8" } }
//! ```
//!
//! One key, [`MODEL`], read on every request. Absent or blank is **not** a
//! default mesa names: it means no `-m` is passed at all, so `auris` picks its
//! own default model and an unconfigured install runs the argv it ran before
//! this setting existed. See [`listen_model`] and `docs/live.md`. A second
//! key, [`ENGINE`] (`"server"` | `"browser"`, default `"server"`, mesa task
//! 1388), names what the **page** listens with.
//!
//! ## Audio
//!
//! A ninth section picks the engine the **server** runs speech through and
//! where the `naru-audio` daemon listens (mesa task 1388):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "audio": { "engine": "naru-audio", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:7870" } }
//! ```
//!
//! [`ENGINE`] is `"legacy"` (the external `auris`/`kokoro-rs` binaries, the
//! built-in) or `"naru-audio"`; [`URL`] defaults to [`audio::DEFAULT_URL`] and
//! `NARU_AUDIO_URL` overrides it. See [`audio_engine`], [`audio_url`] and
//! `docs/config.md`.
//!
//! ## Keymap
//!
//! An eighth section rebinds the web UI's **global** keyboard shortcuts (mesa
//! task 1079). (The seventh, `guard`, is the cost guard's — it has no Settings
//! UI and is documented in `docs/cost-guard.md`.)
//!
//! ```json
//! { "keymap": { "create-task": ["n"], "focus-left": ["a", "ArrowLeft"] } }
//! ```
//!
//! One entry per action mesa binds ([`KEYMAP_ACTIONS`]), holding a **list** of
//! chords because the spatial nav answers to a letter *and* an arrow. An
//! absent action is the chords mesa ships, so defaults are never written —
//! only overrides are. This is the one section nothing in Rust reads: the
//! shortcuts are the page's, and the server's job is to store them and to
//! refuse what the editor refuses — an unknown action, a malformed chord, and
//! a chord bound to two actions at once. See [`save_keymap`] and
//! `docs/keyboard.md`.

/// delimiter) is refused rather than guessed at, since a value that happened
/// to hold a `'` would close the run; and arithmetic is refused wherever it
/// is on the stack, since it re-parses what it is given. So the lexer is
/// still not a security boundary a bash grammar has to be trusted to — the
