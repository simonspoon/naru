//! The server's registry of **detached** script runs (mesa task 1224) — the
//! runs the Scripts page starts, walks away from, reopens and stops.
//!
//! The whole new capability is a second *caller* of [`scripts::Streaming`],
//! not a second executor: `core::scripts` is unchanged, and so are the two
//! older run routes. A detached run is that same
//! [`scripts::Streaming::stream`] call with a different pair of closures —
//! an `emit` that **always returns `true`** (no reader owns this run, so a
//! tab closing must never kill it) and a `cancelled` that reads this
//! registry's stop flag instead of a response channel's `is_closed`. The
//! captured and streamed routes keep the opposite ownership — the client
//! hanging up stops the script — and that difference is deliberate.
//!
//! This module is not inside `scripts.rs` because the pump performs the run's
//! two db writes, and `scripts.rs`' whole point is that executing a process is
//! not storage.
//!
//! Three properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! * **The store lock is taken exactly twice per run** — once to open the row,
//!   once to close it — and *never* per output line. A chatty script would
//!   otherwise stall every other request through the single `Store` mutex.
//! * **The db write happens strictly before the registry entry is removed**,
//!   so an attach can never observe "no entry *and* a row still saying
//!   `running`" — the one state that would hang a page on a finished run.
//! * **Snapshot-and-subscribe happens under one acquisition of the entry's
//!   locks**, so no event can be missed between the replay snapshot and the
//!   live subscription, and none can be delivered twice.
//!
//! The replay buffer is bounded by `scripts`' own 64 KiB per-stream cap — the
//! pump buffers *line events*, not raw bytes, so no run can grow it without
//! bound and it needs no cap of its own. The ceiling is that cap plus one
//! JSON envelope per line, which for a script printing very short lines is
//! the larger term; a change to the cap moves this ceiling with it.
