//! HTTP API: an axum router under `/api` over the same `Store` as the CLI.
//!
//! Contract (spec Requirements 7 and 8):
//! - Default (loopback) mode: bound to 127.0.0.1; requests whose `Host` header
//!   is not `localhost:<port>` or `127.0.0.1:<port>` are rejected (DNS
//!   rebinding).
//! - LAN mode (`serve --lan`): bound to 0.0.0.0 so other devices on the local
//!   network can reach it; the Host-header check is skipped (the user has opted
//!   into no-auth LAN trust — there is no enumerable allowlist of LAN hosts).
//! - Mutating methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) require
//!   `Content-Type: application/json` (cross-site form posts) in BOTH modes.
//! - Status codes: 404 unknown path id, 422 validation errors and unknown
//!   body ids, 409 cycle. Error bodies use the CLI shape:
//!   `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`.
//! - The built frontend (`frontend/dist`, embedded at compile time) is served
//!   at `/`, with SPA fallback to `index.html` (spec Requirement 9).

/// detected here (task-status, not live-session, is the "in process" signal)
/// — the reaper is what notices it (mesa task 1191): [`todo_reaper_tick`]
/// files an inbox alert for a dispatched session that ended, or sat idle an
/// hour, without closing its `in_progress` task, and leaves the task itself
/// for a person to move. A restart forgets the dispatches spawned before it,
/// and a session it never dispatched is not watched at all.
///
/// "Busy" is a **count**, not a flag (mesa task 777), and is the **max** of
/// two independent signals (mesa task 802):
/// `max(in_progress leaf count, live-work session count)`. The second is the
/// number of `claude` sessions running under this project's `local_path` that
/// hold a live shell child or a live subagent — a session `claude agents`
/// reports as `done` while a Bash call is still running is not done, and
/// filling its slot would put a second agent in the same checkout. `max`
/// rather than a sum because a session working a genuinely `in_progress` leaf
/// is both signals at once. It is deliberately one-directional: live work can
/// only *withhold* dispatch, and an unavailable `claude` counts as zero live
/// sessions, so the task-status signal below still stands on its own.
///
/// A project's `in_progress` **leaf** tasks occupy slots, and the tick fills
/// up to
/// `config::todo_concurrency()` — the user's per-project ceiling, default 1,
/// so an unconfigured install behaves exactly as before. The limit is read
/// once at the top of every tick rather than at startup, the same
/// read-per-use rule the spawn templates follow, which is what makes an edit
/// land on the next tick with no restart. Lowering it never touches work in
/// flight: those tasks stay `in_progress` and the tick simply picks nothing
/// new for that project until the count falls back under the limit.
///
/// An `in_progress` task that has subtasks is an **umbrella**, not a worker,
/// so it occupies no slot (mesa task 570). A project whose only `in_progress`
/// tasks are umbrellas is fully idle by the count, but the pick narrows from
/// `Store::next_task` (any actionable todo in the project) to
/// `Store::next_subtask` (an actionable todo *under* one of those umbrellas)
/// — an open umbrella unblocks its own children and nothing else, so the
/// watcher never starts unrelated work alongside a parent someone is still
/// holding. That narrowing is decided once per project, before the fill loop:
/// a leaf claimed inside the loop is nobody's parent, so it cannot change the
/// answer mid-loop.
///
/// The invariant that keeps this to *at most* `limit` watcher-spawned agents
/// per project is [`deepest_actionable`]: whatever the pick, the watcher
/// claims an actionable *leaf*, which occupies a slot on the next tick. It
/// never claims a task that still has actionable subtasks — that task would
/// otherwise read as an umbrella one tick later, count toward nothing, and
/// get a further agent spawned on its own child *outside* the limit's
/// accounting. (Residual, inherent to the status-not-liveness signal: a *new*
/// subtask created under an already-`in_progress` task mid-run does turn it
/// into an umbrella, and the next tick dispatches that child alongside
/// whoever holds the parent.)
///
/// Claiming before the next pick is also what terminates the fill loop:
/// both picks filter `status = 'todo'`, so a just-claimed task is invisible
/// to the following iteration. (Residual of filling more than one slot at a
/// time: a parent whose *last* actionable child this loop just claimed is
/// itself actionable to the next iteration, so a limit above 1 can put an
/// agent on the roll-up while its child is still running. It stays inside
/// the limit and inside the umbrella rule — the parent counts as an umbrella
/// from the next tick on — and is the cost of "fill to the limit now"
/// rather than "one per tick".)
///
/// Two-phase, like `spawn_project_agent`: the store lock is held only long
/// enough to decide and claim (phase 1), then dropped before the blocking
/// `claude --bg` shell-outs (phase 2) — holding it across a spawn would
/// freeze every other API request (each needs the same lock) for as long as
/// `claude --bg` takes to start (node startup, ~0.5s+, per the Agents-tab
/// comments) times however many projects this tick dispatches.

/// One reaper pass: stop the sessions the todo-watcher dispatched whose task

/// dispatched whose item has since been triaged (mesa task 1192).
///
/// The watchers' dispatch is one-directional — it starts agents and never
/// ends them — so a session whose task closed sits idle for hours holding a
/// worktree, a simulator and a context window. This is the other end of that:
/// `AppState::todo_dispatched` remembers `(job id → target)` per spawn, and
/// each pass asks the store what became of the target and `claude agents`
/// what became of the session ([`reap_verdict`] decides).
///
/// An inbox item is read through the same verdict: it is "still mine" while
/// it is still pending ([`inbox_item_pending`] — present and not archived)
/// and finished once it is gone (assigned or deleted) or archived, exactly
/// the triage agent's three outcomes. The verdict's three alerts are the
/// todo-watcher's — each is filed against a task, which a triage session has
/// none of — so for an inbox entry they are noted on stderr and otherwise
/// read as the plain verdict under them: live work after triage waits out
/// the grace and is then stopped, a session that is gone is forgotten, and a
/// stalled one is kept.
///
/// Cheap when idle: an empty map returns before any lock and before any
/// subprocess, so a server whose watcher has dispatched nothing spawns no
/// `claude` on this cadence. Everything else is best-effort — a failing
/// listing keeps every entry for the next pass rather than forgetting
/// sessions mesa can no longer see, and a failing stop keeps its entry so a
/// transient failure retries.
