# Agents (live Claude Code sessions)

The persistent **Agents sidebar** lists Claude Code sessions across projects,
starts new background ones in a selected project's `local_path`, and embeds
terminals attached to running sessions. Like the CC Dashboard it reads
**external** state — here by shelling out to the `claude` CLI
(`src/core/agents.rs`; `MESA_CLAUDE_BIN` overrides the binary for tests) — and
touches the Naru store only to read `local_path`. There is deliberately no
`mesa agent` CLI: an agent in a terminal would just use `claude` directly.

**The spawn command is user-configurable** — `docs/config.md`.
`agents::spawn_bg` is the single spawn chokepoint (the two watchers, this POST
route and `mesa live start` all go through it) and runs the template
`~/.mesa/config.json` gives for that action; this route's key is
**`agent-spawn`**, defaulting to `claude --bg --model opus --agent supervisor -- {prompt}`
(mesa task 1188; the `supervisor` definition is seeded to disk first). The
sections below describe that default. A replacement command owes Naru only its
exit code; see the `POST` route below on the `id: null` case.

**Every session Naru *starts* runs under an agent persona** by default:
`--agent <name>`, **`swe`** — Naru auto-dispatches engineering work, and the
generic assistant persona is the wrong front door for it. The name is a
literal in the template (mesa task 1141, replacing the old `MESA_CLAUDE_AGENT`
env var): to use another agent, or none — an unknown agent name is a hard
startup failure in the claude CLI, not a warning, so a machine without a `swe`
agent needs to drop the flag — edit the `agent-spawn` line in Settings. The
flag is placed after `--bg` and before the `--` prompt separator.
`claude agents --json` and the attach bridge don't start a session, so neither
takes it — and neither is affected by the templates, so a template pointing at
a different tool yields sessions the sidebar can't list or attach to.

- `GET /api/projects/{id}/agents` → `{path, agents}` via `claude agents
  --json` (sessions started under that folder, background and interactive),
  filtered to `local_path` **in Rust** (`agents::is_under`) against each
  session's own `cwd`, not via `claude`'s `--cwd` flag — live QA on mesa task
  310 found a session whose cwd exactly equaled the filter dir missing from
  `--cwd`-filtered output while present unfiltered (task 313); the exact
  trigger was never characterized, so Naru filters deterministically instead
  of trusting that black box. Cached 2s per folder in
  `AppState.agents_cache` (each list call costs ~0.5s of node startup; the UI
  polls every 3s). No `local_path` → `{path: null, agents: []}`, not an error.
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/agents` (body `{prompt?}`) → runs the
  `agent-spawn` command (`claude --bg` by default) in `local_path` and returns
  `{id}` — the short job id parsed from the "backgrounded · <id>" receipt, or
  **`null`** when the command printed no such line, which a configured
  replacement is entitled to do. A null id is still `201`: the session exists
  and the next list call shows it, Naru just has nothing to open an attach pane
  with. Without a prompt the session starts idle.
  No/missing `local_path` is `validation`; a failing/missing `claude` CLI is
  **502 `unavailable`** on both endpoints. Both this route and the list route
  run their subprocess under `spawn_blocking` and hold no lock across it, so
  spawns do **not** serialize behind agent-list polls — a slow spawn observed
  under a *stub* `claude` is a stub artifact, not a Naru lock: `output()`
  waits for pipe EOF, so a stub that forks a fake long-lived session hangs
  the call for that child's lifetime (mesa task 468 — reproduced at 30s;
  the real CLI returns in ~1.0s, idle or with a prompt). Keep stub `--bg`
  branches fork-free.
- `GET /api/agents/{id}/attach?cols=&rows=` upgrades to a **WebSocket bridged
  onto `claude attach <id>` in a PTY** (`bridge_attach` in `src/api.rs`,
  portable-pty): server→client binary frames are raw terminal output;
  client→server binary frames are keystrokes, text frames are JSON control
  (`{"resize":{cols,rows}}`). Closing the socket kills only the attach client —
  the background session keeps running (claude's own attach/detach contract).
  The attach client is given a stable cwd Naru owns, `~/.mesa/workspace`
  (`config::workspace_dir()`, the folder every unbound spawn now uses) — the
  server's own cwd may be anywhere, and Claude Code never persists folder trust
  for the home directory, so a `$HOME` cwd re-prompted on every session.
  Note that `claude attach <id>` on a **finished (`done`) session wakes it**:
  Claude Code prints "Waking session …" and the row comes back into `claude
  agents --json`. Opening a pane on a DONE row therefore restarts that process
  rather than showing a frozen transcript.
  Only background sessions (those with a short `id`) are attachable;
  interactive ones are listed as not-attachable.
- `GET /api/agents` → `Vec<AgentSession>` (bare array, no `path` wrapper) via
  `claude agents --json` with **no `--cwd` filter** — every live session on
  the machine, across every project's folder at once. Backs the global Agents
  sidebar (below) and shares `agents_cache` with the per-project route under a
  sentinel key (`ALL_AGENTS_CACHE_KEY`, a NUL-prefixed string no real
  `local_path` can equal) — same 2s TTL, same "collapse concurrent polls"
  rationale, just keyed once instead of per-folder.
- `POST /api/agents/{id}/stop` → `claude stop <id>`, the other end of the
  spawn (mesa task 1289), answering `{id}`. The Agents sidebar's stop control
  is its only caller. Naru never infers past a session's `state` — that was
  twice a Naru bug (tasks 571, 858) and stays gone — but a **stopped** session
  leaves `claude agents --json`, which is the feed `GET /api/agents` reads, so
  a finished-but-misclassified row is gone from the next poll by that alone —
  no dismiss list, and nothing hidden client-side.
  No confirmation prompt: `claude stop` keeps the conversation and `claude
  attach <id>` resumes it, which is the reversibility that stands in for one.
  Only background sessions have a short id, so an interactive one is not
  stoppable, exactly as it is not attachable. A failing/missing `claude` is
  **502 `unavailable`**; a malformed id is **422 `validation`**, the same argv
  guard `attach` applies.
- **All five agent routes share one mode-dependent access gate**,
  `require_agent_access`. Terminal access is code execution — a strictly
  stronger capability than the task CRUD the rest of the API exposes — so the
  browser-as-confused-deputy holes stay closed in BOTH modes; what differs is
  who may connect:
  - **Default (loopback) mode** stacks three checks: `require_loopback` (peer
    address via `ConnectInfo` — refuses any non-local peer), `require_local_host`
    (Host allowlist — the DNS-rebinding defense: a same-origin GET carries no
    Origin and the peer is the victim's own loopback, so only the Host header,
    the page's rebound hostname rather than `localhost`, still distinguishes a
    rebinding page), and `require_local_origin` (Origin allowlist — refuses
    cross-site fetch/WebSocket; WebSockets are exempt from CORS, so the attach
    socket leans on this entirely; Origin-less non-browser clients pass).
  - **`--lan` mode** serves LAN peers (the opt-in "trust every device on the
    LAN" posture includes the terminal, so the web UI — including attach — works
    from a remote machine), but composes two ordered, interdependent checks
    (`require_lan_page_access`) that keep
    hostile *pages* out: `require_lan_agent_host` — Host must be
    `localhost:<port>` or an IP-literal on the serve port (plus the portless
    forms browsers send when the port is 80), which kills DNS rebinding without
    enumerating LAN addresses (a rebound page's requests carry its own DNS
    hostname, never an IP literal; browse the UI by IP from remote machines, or
    start the server with `--lan --allow-host <name>` to trust that exact
    hostname too — repeatable, matched case-insensitively and in full, on the
    serve port, so every *other* DNS name stays refused) —
    **then** `require_origin_matches_host` — a browser Origin must exactly match
    that vetted Host, **or** be a local page (embedded UI / vite dev) from a
    **loopback peer**. The loopback scope on the local-page allowance is
    load-bearing: without it a *remote* browser showing a hostile `localhost:*`
    page would pass and open the attach WebSocket cross-origin (the WS is exempt
    from CORS). Order matters — the Origin match trusts the Host, so the Host is
    validated first. The peer-sensitive branch is pinned by `src/api.rs` unit
    tests (the shell gate always sees a loopback peer).
- **Writing a project's `local_path` carries `require_agent_access`** (on
  `create`/`update`, mesa task 1022 — the same reversal tasks 1004 and 1021
  made for the library and Settings, replacing a loopback-only check). It is
  the folder `claude --bg` runs in — an execution anchor, not mere data — so
  it belongs in the agent routes' capability class rather than plain CRUD. In
  **default** mode the new gate is strictly stronger than the old one
  (loopback peer plus local Host plus local Origin). Under **`--lan`** it
  relaxes rather than refuses: a page this server handed out may set it,
  exactly as it may already open a terminal in that folder, while a rebinding
  page (DNS-name Host) and a cross-site page (foreign Origin) stay refused.
  Every other project field stays writable under `--lan` with no gate at all.
  `scripts/agents-check.sh` drives the Host/Origin half over real HTTP; the
  peer half is `lan_page_may_write_local_path_but_not_from_a_rebound_page` in
  `src/api.rs`.
- Gate: `scripts/agents-check.sh` (stub `claude`, asserts the JSON contract and
  the local_path CLI plumbing). The WS bridge itself is verified by live QA.

## Global Agent sidebar

A persistent, collapsible right-hand rail (`AgentSidebar`,
`frontend/src/components/AgentSidebar.tsx`) shows every live session across
every project, with room to attach several at once, arranged as a tree of
resizable/rearrangeable, mixed-orientation panes. The session list itself is
**not** one of those panes (mesa task 414 pulled it out of the tree): it's a
fixed rail docked to the sidebar body's own right edge
(`.agent-sidebar-list-rail`), always full body height, with its own
independent drag-resize handle and collapse toggle — separate from the tile
area beside it, where the tree of attached agent panes lives and reflows
into whatever space the rail leaves. Rendered once in `App.tsx`, as a sibling
of `<main>` outside the hash router, so it is never remounted by navigation;
the same persistent-shell pattern the left `Sidebar` and `CommandPalette`
already use.

- Data: `listAllAgents()` (`GET /api/agents`, 3s poll) for the session list,
  plus `listProjects()` on that same 3s poll (mesa task 898 — this sidebar is
  a permanent mount, so the one-shot fetch it used to make froze the list for
  the life of the page: a project added or unarchived in the nav, or created
  by an agent straight through the CLI, only appeared after a browser
  refresh) to label each session with the project whose `local_path` is a
  prefix of its `cwd` (longest match wins for
  nested folders) — the same path-prefix relationship `agents::is_under`
  matches on for the per-project route above. A session under no known
  project's folder shows its raw `cwd`.
- **A session is active if it is on the list and not `done`** (mesa task 861).
  Those are the two halves: `claude agents --json` lists live processes, so a
  session Naru can see there is still under way (task 858) — and upstream
  reporting `state === "done"` is the one claim Naru takes at face value,
  because it is the session saying its own work is finished. The list is
  therefore grouped into three collapsible sections — BLOCKED (`state ===
  "blocked"`, tested first), DONE (`state === "done"`) and ACTIVE (everything
  else) — each a `<button>` header toggling its own
  `collapsedSections[bucket]` entry; DONE starts collapsed, BLOCKED/ACTIVE
  start open. An empty bucket renders no header at all (not an empty section).
  `blocked` keeps its own section because a session waiting on a permission
  prompt is live but is the one that needs a person. `AgentSession` carries no
  completion timestamp (`claude agents --json` reports only `startedAt`), so
  DONE keeps the list's own `startedAt` desc order as the closest available
  proxy for "most recently finished".
- **Only `done` demotes; no other `state` does.** Naru used to derive
  "finished" from `state` in two further ways, and both were Naru
  second-guessing a field it does not own — they are gone (task 858) and stay
  gone:
  - `failed`/`stopped` are still ACTIVE. A terminal `state` never meant the
    process was gone — every session reported `done` was still running
    (measured, mesa task 571 — 33 of 33), and the work that turn started
    routinely outlives the report (task 802, the counts below). DONE here
    means "upstream calls the work finished", not "the process exited"; a
    session still leaves the sidebar only by dropping out of the list.
  - the `idle`+`working` reclassification (`isStaleWorking`) and its muted
    dashed badge are gone. Upstream computes `state` live (it is persisted
    nowhere, and `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` has no `state` key) and it
    **sticks**: on claude 2.1.220 three inbox-watcher sessions sat at
    `status: "idle"` + `state: "working"` for 90+ minutes after their final
    turn, while sessions with byte-identical transcript tails reported `done`.
    Age, process liveness and the daemon's `bg settled` sweep were all ruled
    out as the mechanism (mesa task 571). Naru now reports that pair as what
    upstream says it is — working — rather than inferring past it.
  - a false `blocked` is the third measured instance of the same lesson
    (mesa task 1289). Upstream persists its verdict to
    `~/.claude/jobs/<id>/state.json`, and there it took `needs`/`detail`
    verbatim from the tail of the agent's own closing sentence — a
    `live-summary` run that had just summarised a conversation *about*
    blocked agents ended "…waiting on the user, not that it is stuck", and
    was classified as being one; a `done` sibling of the same template
    carries synthesised prose ("session 115 summary saved: …") and a
    populated `output.result` instead. It is sticky and terminal — still
    `blocked` on a re-poll 12s later, that file 4.5 h stale — and the
    summary itself had already been written 5s before the verdict was
    stamped. Naru reports it as-is for the reason it reports sticky
    `working` as-is, and here it could not do otherwise: across 188 rows of
    `claude agents --json --all` `waitingFor` was absent on every one, the
    blocked row was identical to the pid-carrying `done` rows in every key
    but `state`, and the two transcript tails are structurally identical
    (`end_turn`, no dangling `tool_use`, no permission request) — nothing
    Naru reads separates a false `blocked` from a true one, and the fields
    that do differ (`output`, `firstTerminalAt`) live in that private jobs
    file, which Naru neither reads nor owns, and separate terminal from
    live rather than false from genuine. The cost is display plus two
    waits: the todo watcher's reaper (`reap_verdict` in `src/api.rs`) never
    reads `state` at all — only `pid`, `status` and the two counts below —
    so dispatch is not held up, but the session keeps the BLOCKED section
    open and, under Auto Tile, a pane that never closes (the tile set is
    `bucketOf(a) !== 'DONE'`, and a falsely-blocked session never reaches
    DONE); `agents::job_running` counts any state outside
    `done`/`failed`/`stopped` as running, so such a job holds a resting
    `listen` waiting to its 10-minute cap (mesa task 1155); and
    such a row no longer reaches `GET /api/live`'s derived `blocked` at
    all — since mesa task 1293 `agents::blocked_on` requires a `waitingFor`
    naming a permission, so a blocked row with no reason (which is every one
    of those 188) answers nothing and the page's watchdog has no rising edge
    to turn into a spoken `notice: permission` turn.
- **Two mesa-derived counts report what a session is doing**
  (mesa task 802): `liveShells` and `liveSubagents` on every `AgentSession`.
  Upstream's `state` reaches `done` the moment a turn ends, while the work
  that turn started is still running — Naru computes the liveness upstream
  doesn't report. Since task 858 these no longer decide whether a session is
  running (list presence and `state` do, above), so the sidebar no longer
  shows them as a badge (mesa task 1484: the card's meta line says "N running
  below", counted from `children`). They still
  **do** decide a slot in the todo watcher, where the question is different: a
  project is busy if a session under it holds work in flight, not merely if a
  finished-but-alive process is still listed — counting mere presence there
  would wedge dispatch behind an idle session (`docs/todo-watcher.md`).
  - `liveShells` counts the session pid's **direct** children whose `comm`
    basename is in `{zsh, bash, sh, dash}`, from **one** `ps -A -o
    pid=,ppid=,etime=,comm=,args=` per list refresh — not one `ps` per
    session (`etime` and `args` are there for the child cards below; the
    count reads neither). Claude Code
    spawns one `/bin/zsh -c 'source …/shell-snapshots/… && eval …'` child per
    Bash tool call (it is *not* a persistent shell), so a live shell child *is*
    a Bash call in flight right now. The allowlist is why it is not an
    "any child" rule: every working session also carries a `caffeinate` child,
    which is not work — counting it would mark every session busy forever.
  - `liveSubagents` counts `<projects_dir>/*/<sessionId>/subagents/*.jsonl`
    whose mtime is within `cc::ACTIVE_SECS` (90s, shared with the CC
    dashboard's own liveness window). The `children` cards and the pending-call
    pool use a wider rule (mesa task 1612): a subagent whose last record is a
    `tool_use` still awaiting its result stays listed as running for up to
    `DELEGATE_TOOL_CALL_SECS` (30 min), since it writes nothing during one long
    call; a finished or otherwise idle one still drops after 90s. Subagents run **in-process** — there is
    no child to count — so a freshly written transcript is the only signal
    available. The project slug is unknown at this point, so every slug
    directory is checked for the session id, the same glob shape `cc.rs` uses.
  - Both probes **fail open to `0`**: no `ps` (or a platform without one), no
    projects dir, an unreadable folder or an unparseable row all yield `0`,
    never an `Err`. This is a best-effort liveness probe hanging off the agents
    endpoints and the todo watcher (`docs/todo-watcher.md`), and it must never
    turn either into a failure. Enrichment happens in `list_sessions`, so the
    per-project route, the global route and the `agents_cache` TTL all see the
    same numbers for the same one `ps`.
  - Neither field comes from the CLI payload, so both are `#[serde(default)]`
    (parsing `claude agents --json` must not require them) and both cross the
    wire camelCase. Regressions: the pure counters have Rust unit tests in
    `src/core/agents.rs` (a synthetic `ps` table, mtime windows, fail-open);
    `scripts/agents-check.sh` only pins that both fields are on the wire and
    `0` for the stub's nonexistent pids — faking a process tree from bash
    would test the fake.
- **`children` is those counts in detail** (mesa task 1277): a `Vec<AgentChild>`
  on every `AgentSession`, one entry per fresh subagent transcript and per live
  shell child, so the sidebar can hang a small card off each agent row instead
  of only showing a count. It is **additive** — `liveShells` and
  `liveSubagents` keep their exact meanings and values, and are derived from
  the same walk that builds the list so count and cards can never disagree.
  - A child carries `id`, `kind` (`subagent` | `shell`), `name`, `detail`,
    `startedAt`, `contextTokens` and `state` (`running` | `finished`). Always
    present, empty when nothing is live; subagents come first, then shells, and
    the page decides the order it renders (`frontend/src/agentChild.ts`:
    running before finished, subagents before shells).
  - `id` is a **subagent's transcript file stem** (`agent-<name>-<hex>`, mesa
    task 1278) — free, since the walk that builds the row already holds the
    path, and a bounded pointer, so it belongs on the record. It is the file's
    name and never the sidecar's `agentType`: two runs of one agent type share
    a *name*, and the id is what the pane below reads the right one back by.
    It is `null` for a shell, and that is not an omission — a `ps` row carries
    nothing transcript-derived, so a Bash call in flight has no identity beyond
    the command line already in `name`.
  - A **subagent** is named by the `agentType` of the `.meta.json` sidecar
    Claude Code writes beside each `agent-<hash>.jsonl` (missing or unparseable
    → the file stem, never nameless); its `detail` is the newest assistant
    line's prose, else the tool that message called; its `contextTokens` is
    that line's `input + cache_read + cache_creation`; its `startedAt` is the
    first line's `timestamp`, else the file's birth time. All of it comes from
    `cc::subagent_pulse`, a **separate** reader from `cc::session_pulse`
    because that one skips sidechain lines on purpose and every line in one of
    these files is a sidechain line.
  - A subagent that has handed back its report reads `finished` and is still
    listed until its mtime leaves the `cc::ACTIVE_SECS` window — the same
    lingering the live count already had, now visible. `liveSubagents` counts
    only the `running` ones.
  - A **shell** is named by its full command line (`ps -o args=`, capped by
    `cc::sanitize_capped` like any other string Naru lifts out of a file it
    does not own), dated by `etime` counted back from the same `now` the
    counts use, and is always `running`: the process leaves the table the
    instant its Bash call returns. It has no `detail` and no context window.
  - Same fail-open rule as the counts: an unreadable transcript, a missing
    sidecar or a `ps` row that does not parse costs a field or a row, never
    the request. `scripts/agents-check.sh` plants two subagent transcripts
    under a throwaway `MESA_CC_PROJECTS_DIR` and pins the populated shape;
    shell children stay with the Rust unit tests, for the reason above.
- **Tapping a child card opens it as a read-only pane beside its parent**
  (mesa task 1278) — the same gesture that opens a session's chat pane, one
  level down. The pane tree grows a second leaf kind, `child`, whose id names
  its parent and which child it is (`frontend/src/agentChild.ts`:
  `child:<parent job id>:sub:<transcript id>` for a subagent,
  `child:<parent job id>:cmd:<command line>` for a shell). Neither key is an
  index — cards reorder and drop out on every 3s poll, and a pane must not be
  renamed underneath the reader — and a command line is a shell's whole
  identity for the whole of its life, since the process leaves the table the
  instant its Bash call returns. The card keeps its `stopPropagation`, so a tap
  on it never toggles the parent's attach pane underneath. A child pane owns no
  PTY, so every close path goes through `releasePane`, which asks `ptyPool`
  about agent panes only; and because Auto Tile owns the layout while it is on,
  its rebuild carries the open child panes through after the agents rather than
  closing them on the next poll — a child is not a session, so the sessions
  list can neither ask for one nor withdraw one.
  - **Data: `GET /api/cc/sessions/{sessionId}/subagents/{agentId}/chat`**,
    polled at 3s, `cc::subagent_chat`. `get_cc_session_chat`'s sibling in every
    respect — no `Store`, no `sync`, on `spawn_blocking`, the same
    `CcSessionChat` shape, the router-wide `guard` layer and no per-route gate
    (the bodies are a strict subset of what the chat, graph and node-text
    routes already serve for the same session; do not gate one of the four
    without the others). The read is **session-scoped**: the file is probed at
    `<slug>/<session_id>/subagents/<agent_id>.jsonl`, so an agent id belonging
    to another session does not resolve, and both ids are validated to the id
    charset before any filesystem call and still go through `transcript_path`.
    Its one real difference from the session reader is that it passes
    `skip_sidechain: false` to `chat_turns` — **every** line of a subagent
    transcript carries `isSidechain: true`, which the session reader skips on
    purpose, so reusing it unchanged would answer an empty conversation for a
    subagent that is talking perfectly well (`subagent_pulse`'s own reason for
    existing beside `session_pulse`). `pending_question` is always null.
  - The conversation is the **same renderer** as the main chat —
    `ChatTranscript` (mesa task 1278 split it out of `AgentChat`), so turn
    grouping, the collapsed tool runs, follow-to-tail and the
    `resolveImageSrc={() => null}` refusal of every image are one
    implementation, not two that drift. What stayed in `AgentChat` is
    everything that *writes*: the composer and the question card both type into
    a PTY, and a subagent has none. There is no input box in a child pane and
    no view toggle — there is no terminal to switch to. The transcript's first
    user line is the task its parent handed it, so it is labelled
    `<parent> → <subagent>` rather than `you`.
  - **A shell pane shows the command, an elapsed clock and its state, and no
    output** — deliberately, because Naru has none to show. A shell child is
    built from a `ps` probe whose row holds only `pid, ppid, etime, comm, args`
    and nothing transcript-derived, and whose `args` is Claude Code's own
    `zsh -c 'source …shell-snapshot && eval …'` wrapper rather than the command
    the agent ran — so matching it back to a transcript `tool_use` would be a
    guess, and a wrong guess renders some other call's output under this one.
    Claude Code does not stream a Bash call's output into the transcript while
    it runs either, and the process leaves the table the instant the call
    returns (so a shell child is `Running` by construction and never reaches
    `finished`) — there is no later moment at which the pane could fill the gap
    in. The pane says so rather than showing an empty box.
  - The live figures — tokens, elapsed, state — come off the parent's row on
    the sidebar's own session poll, so a child that has dropped out of its
    parent's `children` (a subagent leaving the freshness window, a shell whose
    call returned) leaves the pane showing fewer of them rather than closing
    itself: a subagent's transcript is still on disk and still readable. A
    parent that has left the session list takes the session id the transcript
    is filed under with it, and the pane says that instead.
  - Pure logic lives in `frontend/src/agentChild.ts` (vitest-covered per
    CLAUDE.md's frontend-test rule): the pane id, its parse, the
    `isChildPaneId` predicate every `ptyPool` call is guarded by, the lookup
    back onto the live row, and the header/prompt labels.
- **Two more mesa-derived fields report what a session is *saying*** (mesa task
  869): `lastResponse` and `contextTokens`, also on every `AgentSession`, also
  `#[serde(default)]` and camelCase, and filled in the same `list_sessions`
  enrichment step so both routes and the cache agree. They ride on the existing
  payload deliberately — the sidebar polls one list, and a per-row fetch would
  turn one poll into one request per session.
  - Both are read **live off the session's `.jsonl` transcript**
    (`cc::session_pulse`), not out of the `cc_*` tables: what a session said
    seconds ago is younger than any ingest. That makes it the fourth read to go
    to the files rather than the db, beside `cc live`, `cc text` and `cc chat`.
  - `lastResponse` is the newest assistant prose, chosen by exactly the rule
    `cc::chat_turns` uses (`type == "assistant"` plus the message's `text`
    blocks) — Claude Code writes its own injections as `user` lines whose
    content is an array of `text` blocks, so a shape test alone would report a
    skill body as something the agent said. It is untrusted model-authored text
    on a 3-second poll, so it goes through `cc::sanitize_capped` (≤200 chars,
    control characters dropped) like every other transcript-derived string.
  - `contextTokens` is the newest assistant message's `input +
    cache_read + cache_creation` tokens: the size of the newest *request's*
    input, which is what "how full is the context window" means. Not output
    tokens, and not a sum across messages. It is picked independently of
    `lastResponse` — a session's newest line is routinely a tool call, which
    carries usage but no prose.
  - The transcript tail read here is 256 KiB, not the chat view's 2 MiB: this
    runs for **every** listed session on every poll, where the chat window
    backs one open pane.
  - Fails open exactly as the counts do — no transcript, an unreadable file, no
    assistant line, no usage all answer `null`, never an `Err`. Rust unit tests
    in `src/core/cc.rs` cover the token arithmetic, newest-prose-wins, the
    injected-`user`/sidechain exclusions and the missing transcript.
- The liveness test is `isRunningAgent` in `frontend/src/agentProject.ts`,
  **not** a local helper in `AgentSidebar.tsx`, because three surfaces ask the
  same question and must not drift: the sidebar's `bucketOf` above, the
  project sidebar's per-project "an agent is running here" dot
  (`Sidebar.tsx`), and the board card's live marker
  (`boardView.ts::liveAgentCount`). Its two exclusions are `pid !== null` and
  `state !== "done"` — both upstream's own fields, rather than an inference
  Naru draws on top of them. This bucketed list is the body of
  the 'Agents' rail's own content (`AgentListContent`), rendered directly by
  `AgentSidebar` next to the tile area — not a member of the pane tree below.
- **The 'Agents' list rail** (mesa task 414): a fixed sibling of the tile
  area inside `.agent-sidebar-body` (a row flexbox), not a tree leaf.
  `listWidth`/`listCollapsed`/`listResizing` are their own `AgentSidebar`
  state, independent of the tile area's `root` tree and of the whole
  sidebar's own `width`/`collapsed`. Its own drag-resize handle
  (`.agent-sidebar-list-resize-handle`, hand-rolled `mousedown`/
  `document`-level `mousemove`/`mouseup`, same pattern as the sidebar's own
  width handle) reads the distance from the pointer to the sidebar body's
  own right edge (measured off a `bodyRef` rect, not the viewport), floored
  on both sides — `MIN_LIST_WIDTH` for the rail, `MIN_TILE_WIDTH` for the
  tile area beside it — so dragging one can't squeeze the other to nothing.
  Its own collapse toggle (`.agent-sidebar-list-toggle`, a `‹`/`›` button in
  the rail's own header) shrinks it to a thin full-height strip
  (`.agent-sidebar-list-rail.collapsed`), independent of the whole sidebar's
  own collapse — collapsing the rail hands its space back to the tile area;
  collapsing the whole sidebar (below) hides both.
- Layout: **agent** panes live in a **split-tree** (`SplitNode`/`LeafNode` in
  `AgentSidebar.tsx`), not a flat list — the tile area beside the list rail.
  Each node is either a leaf (one **pane** — `PaneShell`, wrapping an
  attached agent terminal via `AgentPane`, rendered through the shared pty
  pool — see below) or a split: an ordered list of children, each carrying
  its own `ratio` (that slot's flex-grow share within the split) and
  oriented `row` (side-by-side) or `column` (stacked). The root is always a
  split node, never a bare leaf, but an **empty** one (no children) is a
  valid and common state — no agent panes open, just the list rail beside an
  empty tile area. Clicking a session in the list rail toggles its **agent**
  pane in or out of the tree (`insertLeaf`/`removeLeaf`); a new pane always
  appends to the **root** split's own children, regardless of how deep or
  mixed the tree has become elsewhere — there's no "insert into the
  currently-focused split" concept. An agent pane's **close** button removes
  it from the shared pty pool (below) and detaches (the background session
  itself keeps running, unaffected — same contract as the per-project tab's
  detach) without touching any other open pane. `SplitNodeView`, the
  component that recursively renders one split's own direct children, is
  declared at module scope (not nested inside `AgentSidebar`) so its
  identity never changes across a re-render — nesting a per-split component
  inside `AgentSidebar`'s body would remount every open pane's `PtySlot`
  beneath it on every poll tick.
  - **Mixed orientation via a per-divider toggle**: every divider carries a
    small button (`.agent-sidebar-divider-toggle`, centered on the strip)
    showing the orientation clicking it would *produce* — `⬌` on a column
    divider (splits its two adjacent panes side-by-side), `⬍` on a row
    divider (stacks them back). Clicking it extracts that divider's two
    adjacent children, wraps them in a new split node of the opposite
    orientation, and splices that node back into the same slot — this is
    the one mechanism for going from a flat stack to a mixed, arbitrarily
    nested layout, and back. There's no global toggle, context menu, or
    per-pane toolbar; the interaction stays scoped to the exact divider the
    tree operation affects. The toggle button's `onClick` stops propagation
    so the divider's own resize-drag `onMouseDown` never also fires on the
    same gesture, and the drag handler separately ignores the button as a
    mousedown target (belt-and-suspenders, since `mousedown` precedes
    `click`).
  - **Pruning via canonicalization**: every tree mutation (toggle, close,
    reopen) is followed by canonicalizing the whole tree against three
    rules — drop a split left with zero children, inline a split left with
    exactly one child (its lone child takes over the wrapper's own ratio
    slot), and merge a split into its parent when both share the same
    orientation (the child's own children splice in directly, ratios
    rescaled to fit the slot's budget). The merge rule is what makes
    toggling a divider and toggling it back a true round trip — without it,
    nesting would only grow and a second toggle would stop restoring the
    original layout. Together the three rules guarantee a close (or a
    toggle that leaves a split empty or singleton) never renders a dangling
    empty or zero-size region, and reopening a previously-closed agent from
    the session list appends a fresh pane at the root without disturbing the
    rest of the layout.
  - **Resizable**: a divider between two adjacent children
    (`.agent-sidebar-pane-divider`) is drag-resizable — hand-rolled
    `mousedown`/`document`-level `mousemove`/`mouseup`, the same pattern as
    the sidebar's own width handle below. The drag is axis-aware per the
    divider's own split: it reads `clientX` and resizes width for a `row`
    divider, `clientY` and resizes height for a `column` divider, measured
    against that split node's own container (not the whole sidebar), so a
    divider several levels deep resizes only its own two adjacent children
    regardless of how the rest of the tree is shaped. Floored at
    `MIN_PANE_PX` so a drag can't collapse a pane to zero.
  - **Rearrangeable**: each pane's header still has a drag grip (`⠿`,
    `.agent-sidebar-pane-grip`) wired to `@dnd-kit/sortable`
    (`useSortable`/`SortableContext`) — the same library and pattern
    `KanbanBoard.tsx` uses for column drag-and-drop, but scoped per split
    node instead of one flat list: one `SortableContext` per `SplitNodeView`
    instance (all nested under the sidebar's single top-level `DndContext`,
    dnd-kit's standard multi-container pattern), listing only that split's
    own **leaf** children — a nested split occupying a sibling slot has no
    grip and isn't itself draggable. `strategy` follows the split's own
    orientation: `horizontalListSortingStrategy` for `row`,
    `verticalListSortingStrategy` for `column`. `collisionDetection` is
    `pointerWithin`, not dnd-kit's default — every pane can span the whole
    sidebar, so resolving the drop target off the *dragged pane's own*
    (translated) box would let a wide/tall pane's box overlap several
    candidates the cursor isn't even over; `pointerWithin` picks whichever
    pane the raw pointer position is actually inside.
  - **Drop position on the target pane picks between two gestures** — a
    center 40%×40% box vs. the outer edges, quartered into left/right/
    top/bottom by whichever axis the pointer deviates from center more
    (`computeDropEdge`, the standard tiling-WM/VS-Code docking read; a
    cyan `.agent-sidebar-pane-drop-indicator` previews the live zone,
    updated continuously via `onDragMove`):
    - **Center → reorder/move.** Same parent split: a plain sibling
      reorder (`arrayMove`). Different parent split: a cross-split move
      (`moveLeaf`) — the dragged leaf slots into the target's own index in
      *its* split, taking on `DEFAULT_RATIO` there.
    - **Edge → split.** `splitLeafAt` wraps the target and the dragged leaf
      in a brand-new split node — row for a left/right edge, column for
      top/bottom, ordered so left/top puts the dragged leaf first — and
      replaces the target's own slot with that wrapper (which inherits the
      target's ratio there; target and the newly split-in leaf share
      `DEFAULT_RATIO` between themselves). If the new wrapper's
      orientation matches its own parent split's, `canonicalize` splices
      its two children straight back out flat on the next render — which
      is the intended outcome, not a bug to special-case around: dropping
      on the left/right edge of a pane that's already in a row split just
      means "insert as its row-sibling here."
    Either gesture reuses the same per-leaf sortable drop targets — `over`
    is always another leaf's id, in whichever split it lives in, no
    separate `useDroppable` surface for the edge case.
- **Every pane has two views: `term` and `chat`** (mesa task 814). `term` is
  the attached terminal — the original, and the only one you can type into.
  `chat` is the *same* session rendered as a conversation:
  human prompts and assistant replies as markdown bubbles, with each run of
  tool calls between them collapsed into one muted, expandable block. A
  terminal is a screen buffer — it cannot be scrolled back past its scrollback,
  selected across a reflow, or read on a phone; the chat view is the same
  session as ordinary text, which is what makes the phone tier work at all.
  - **Tool runs are collapsed by default**, except the run at the very end.
    Expanded, a session's tens of calls between two replies are a wall of
    shell that buries the conversation the view exists to show, and the
    summary line (`6 steps · EnterWorktree · Bash ×4 · Read`) already says
    what ran; the last run is the exception because on a live session it is
    what the agent is doing *right now*. An explicit click always wins over
    the default, which is why the state is `undefined`-means-default rather
    than a boolean.
  - **Known gaps, deliberate for now.** A tool call shows its *input* target
    and not its **result**, so the view answers "what is it doing" and not
    "how did that go" — the honest half of the conversation this does not
    carry. Adding results needs its own bounding policy (a result is
    unbounded and routinely megabytes, and the whole payload is a 3s poll),
    which is a design decision in its own right, not a widening of this one.
    There is likewise no in-pane **search** and no **subagent** turns (the
    read is main-thread-only, so a fanned-out `Task` is a dead end here).
  - **Data: `GET /api/cc/sessions/{sessionId}/chat`** (`docs/cc-dashboard.md`
    → *Session chat*), polled at 3s. That route reads the transcript file
    directly — no ingest, no store lock — which is what makes it pollable and
    what lets a session Naru spawned seconds ago have a chat view at all.
  - **Two ids, and this is the one place both are needed.** A pane is keyed by
    the short **background job id** (all `claude attach` takes), while a
    transcript is keyed by the **session id**. The session list is the only
    place they are carried together, so `sessionIdFor` resolves one from the
    other and the `chat` button is **disabled** (with the reason in its title)
    for a pane whose session has dropped out of the list.
  - **The terminal is hidden, never unmounted, while chat is showing** — the
    same choice, for the same reason, as the sidebar's own collapse below:
    `display: none` would zero the pty's measured box, so xterm would refit to
    nothing and the attach socket's scrollback would come back reflowed. Both
    views are absolutely positioned over one area, and the inactive terminal is
    `visibility: hidden`, so it keeps its real size. The **chat** is the
    opposite: it owns no connection, so it *is* unmounted when not showing, and
    while the whole sidebar is collapsed it stops polling — nobody polls a view
    nobody can see, the same rule the session-list poll follows.
  - **`chat` is the default view a pane opens in** (mesa task 820). Opening a
    pane is a *read* — you look at an agent to see what it is saying and doing,
    and only sometimes to type at it — so the pane starts in the view that
    answers that, and the terminal is one click away in the same header. The
    default is only the absent-key case: a pane whose session isn't in the
    session list has no transcript to render and still falls back to `term`
    (the same guard that disables the `chat` button), and a pane the reader has
    switched keeps their choice, closed panes included.
  - The view mode lives in `AgentSidebar` state keyed by pane id, not in the
    pane component and not on the tree leaf: a pane is remounted by any
    reparent (a drag-to-edge split, a cross-split move, an auto-tile rebuild),
    so pane-local state would snap back to the terminal on a layout change.
    Closed panes keep their key, so reopening a session restores the view it
    was last read in.
  - **The chat view can be typed into** (mesa task 844): a composer pinned to
    the bottom of the pane — a one-line textarea that grows with its content to
    a cap, and a drawn send icon (a flat `currentColor` polygon, the same
    vocabulary as the inbox transport glyphs, not a typed `➤`). Enter sends,
    Shift+Enter opens a line, and an all-whitespace message sends **nothing**
    (a bare `\r` would submit whatever the agent's own input box already
    holds). It is a flex sibling of the scroll box, not a `sticky` child, so
    the conversation never scrolls underneath it — in a 200px auto-tile that
    overlap is most of the last turn.
    - **There is no send API, and deliberately so.** The chat is a *render* of
      a transcript file; the only channel into a live session is the terminal
      the pane is already attached to. A composed message is therefore **typed
      into that PTY** — `ptyPool.send(<pane id>, chatSendKeys(text))` — exactly
      as a person at the terminal would type it, and the reply comes back
      through the ordinary 3s transcript poll like any other turn. No new
      route, no second write path into a session, and the whole
      `require_agent_access` gate on the attach socket already covers it.
    - The socket belongs to the pooled `PtyTerminal`, so it registers a writer
      with `ptyPool.setSender` **on open** and withdraws it on close/unmount;
      the **writer itself** answers whether the bytes went out, so
      `ptyPool.send` returns `false` both for a leaf with no writer and for one
      whose socket has left `OPEN` — a graceful close leaves the writer
      registered until the `close` event dispatches, and only the terminal
      holds the `readyState` that tells those apart. Either way the composer
      says so rather than dropping the message: a writer handed out during
      `CONNECTING` would swallow what was typed, and an outside writer has no
      keyboard in front of it to notice.
    - **A closed socket is recovered from the chat itself** (mesa task 1290).
      The statement above stands — there is still no send API — but the *way
      back* used to be unreachable: the only thing that reopens a socket is
      `PtyTerminal`'s own reconnect button, and the chat is rendered over the
      terminal view with `visibility: hidden; pointer-events: none`, so for as
      long as a reader is chatting that button can be reached by neither mouse
      nor Tab. So the terminal registers its reopen with
      `ptyPool.setReconnector` exactly as it registers its writer, and
      `ptyPool.reconnect(<pane id>)` offers it by leaf id — the composer's
      failure line carries a `reconnect` press beside the message. Two
      deliberate non-choices: the reconnector is **not** withdrawn when the
      socket closes (unlike the writer — a closed socket is precisely when it
      is the useful one, and a socket that never opened needs it too), and a
      failed send is **never** retried or queued for the new socket. A
      reconnect spawns a fresh `claude attach` whose TUI draws itself over the
      following frames; replaying held keystrokes into a half-drawn input box
      is how they land in the wrong place. Reopening the channel and sending
      are two presses, on purpose.
    - A **multi-line** message is wrapped in bracketed paste
      (`ESC[200~` … `ESC[201~`) rather than sent as raw newlines: a raw `\n` is
      the submit key in the agent's TUI, so three lines would arrive as three
      prompts. CRLF is normalised first, for the same reason. `chatSendKeys`
      (`frontend/src/agentChat.ts`, vitest-covered) is the one place that
      encoding lives.
    - This is the one thing the chat view can do that the terminal cannot do
      better, and it is why the pane defaults to `chat`: read what it is doing,
      say the next thing, without switching views.
  - **A question the agent is waiting on is answered from the chat** (task
    866). When a session stops on an `AskUserQuestion`, the pane grows a card
    at the tail of the conversation — the question, and one button per offered
    answer — and a click answers it. Until this, the one turn where the agent
    had stopped and was waiting for a *person* was the one turn the chat view
    could not act on: you had to switch to the terminal and drive the agent's
    own chooser by keyboard.
    - **Data: `pending_question` on the same 3s payload**
      (`docs/cc-dashboard.md` → *Session chat*) — the last `AskUserQuestion`
      `tool_use` in the window carrying no `tool_result`. No new route, and
      no new poll.
    - **The answer is keystrokes, for the composer's reason.** There is no
      send API; the only channel into a live session is the pane's PTY. The
      chooser numbers its rows (`1. Alpha  2. Beta  3. Gamma`), so a click
      types that **digit** — never "down-arrow *n* times then Enter", because
      the arrows are relative to a cursor Naru cannot see while the digit
      names the row. The rows the chooser appends itself ("Type something",
      "Chat about this") sort after every real option, so a number in range
      never hits one. `chatAnswerKeys` / `CHAT_COMMIT_KEYS` /
      `CHAT_SUBMIT_KEYS` in `frontend/src/agentChat.ts` are the one place
      that encoding lives, vitest-covered like `chatSendKeys`.
    - **Naru cannot see the chooser, so the card walks its steps.** The
      transcript records nothing about a call until the whole call is
      answered; what is known is that a fresh chooser opens on the first
      question and steps forward one question per answer. So the card answers
      in that order — the live question's options are clickable, earlier ones
      show what was picked, later ones are shown but disabled, since a
      keystroke meant for a later question would land on this one. A reader
      who answers in the terminal instead is not stranded: the next poll
      clears the card.
    - **Three keystrokes, because the chooser has three states**, each
      observed against the real CLI rather than assumed: a **single-select**
      row's digit selects *and* commits; a **multi-select** row's digit
      *toggles* it, so that question is finished by a `Tab` onto the chooser's
      own `✔ Submit` tab (the card's "done with this question"); and every
      call except a single single-select one ends on a **review** step
      (`Ready to submit your answers?`), whose `1` the card's "submit answers"
      sends. `chatNeedsReview` is that last rule.
    - **Every press sends exactly one keystroke.** Two keys in one write land
      as one against the real chooser (the second is dropped), and two writes
      with no gap lose the second — so the card can never "helpfully" send the
      next step along with this one, and does not try. Its steps are the
      chooser's steps, one click each. What it deliberately does *not* offer
      is the chooser's own extra rows: the free-text "Type something" (a
      question Naru cannot render as a button — type it in the composer or the
      terminal) and `Esc` to cancel.
    - It fails exactly as the composer does — `ptyPool.send` returning false
      says the socket is gone, and the card says so rather than pretending the
      click landed — and it recovers exactly as the composer does, the same
      `reconnect` press beside the same message (mesa task 1290). A card whose
      socket closed mid-call is the worst place to be stranded: the agent is
      stopped, waiting, and the reader has nothing else to press.
  - **Untrusted text, rendered as markup — deliberately, and narrowly.** Every
    body here is model-authored transcript text, which the CC surfaces
    otherwise render only as a text child or a `title`. The chat view is the
    one place it becomes formatted output, because that *is* the feature. It
    is safe by construction, not by sanitizing: the shared `Markdown`
    component passes **no raw HTML** through (there is no `rehype-raw`, so
    embedded markup renders as inert text), react-markdown strips unsafe URL
    schemes, links carry `rel="noreferrer"`, and `resolveImageSrc` is wired to
    refuse **every** image — so an `![](https://tracker/…)` in a transcript can
    never make the browser issue a request *on its own*. A `[link](…)` still
    becomes a real anchor (and remark-gfm autolinks a bare URL): that is a
    click-gated navigation, not a fetch, and it is the deliberate line — prose
    with working links is the point; prose that phones home on render is not.
    Tool names and targets stay plain text children. Do not add `rehype-raw`
    here, and do not resolve images.
  - Pure logic (turn grouping, the tool-run summary, the clock, the
    follow-the-tail predicate) is `frontend/src/agentChat.ts`, vitest-covered
    per CLAUDE.md's frontend-test rule; `AgentChat.tsx` is a thin renderer over
    it. The chat auto-scrolls to the newest turn **only while the reader is
    already near the bottom**, so scrolling up to read something older is never
    yanked back by the next poll.
- **Collapse never unmounts anything.** `collapsed` (default `true`) toggles
  a CSS class on the `<aside>`; the list and any attached terminal stay
  mounted underneath, hidden via `visibility: hidden` on the inner
  `.agent-sidebar-body` (not `display: none` or a conditional
  `{!collapsed && …}` render) — the layout box, xterm's fitted size, and the
  attach WebSocket are all untouched by a collapse/expand cycle. This is the
  feature's core guarantee: collapse the sidebar mid-session, expand it back
  later, and the terminal is still attached with no reconnect, exactly as if
  the tab had just been sitting in the background. `visibility` also avoids
  the pixel-clipping trap `overflow: hidden` alone has: content narrower than
  its own natural width but positioned inside the still-laid-out (just
  invisible) body can't peek through the collapsed rail's clipped edge.
- **Split and cross-split move also never drop a live session.** A
  drag-to-edge split or a cross-split move reparents a leaf under a
  freshly-minted split-node id, which would otherwise remount every leaf
  underneath — including its attached terminal, since React's keyed
  reconciliation only compares siblings within one parent's array in one
  commit. Each pane's terminal is therefore never rendered directly at its
  tree position: it's portaled once into a stable, pool-owned DOM container
  (`frontend/src/lib/ptyPool.ts` + an always-mounted `PtyPool` + a `PtySlot`
  placeholder at each tree position — shared verbatim with the Terminal
  page, `docs/terminal.md`), and a tree position just relocates that
  container via `appendChild` whenever it mounts there. Only an explicit
  close removes an entry from the pool, so a reorganize preserves the
  `claude attach` scrollback and connection with no reconnect banner. Built
  primarily for the Terminal page's stronger requirement (there's no
  background session to reconnect to there, so the pre-fix behavior was an
  unrecoverable process kill, not just a lost scrollback); fixed here as an
  incidental consequence of sharing the same mechanism.
- The list poll itself pauses while collapsed (`pollMs` only set when
  expanded) — nobody can see the list, and each poll costs a `claude agents`
  subprocess; reopening triggers an immediate one-off fetch.
- **Width**: the whole rail is drag-resizable from its left-edge handle
  (`agent-sidebar-resize-handle`), floored at `MIN_WIDTH` but with **no fixed
  upper cap** — it can be dragged arbitrarily wide. The only ceiling is a
  floor on `main`'s own width (`MIN_MAIN_WIDTH`), measured live off `main`'s
  `getBoundingClientRect()` on every drag move (so it tracks the left nav
  sidebar's actual current width, collapsed or expanded, rather than assuming
  one) — past that point `main`'s content (e.g. the CC Dashboard's cards)
  doesn't overflow the page so much as wrap into illegible slivers, which is
  the thing being floored against, not an arbitrary product limit like the
  sidebar's own old 720px cap. A separate **maximize** toggle
  (`agent-sidebar-maximize`) grows the panel to fill the whole main content
  area instead (`main` display:none via `:has()`), matching the diagram
  canvas's own takeover-view expand toggle; `Escape` restores.
- **Starting a new agent**: a `+ agent` button (`agent-sidebar-add`) sits in
  the header actions next to maximize, visible only while expanded. It opens
  a small form (`agent-sidebar-add-form`) above the pane tree — a project
  `<select>`, an optional first-prompt text input, and start/cancel — rather
  than being part of the split tree itself (it starts a session; it isn't
  one). The project picker only lists projects with a linked folder
  (`local_path` set), since that's where `POST /api/projects/{id}/agents`
  runs `claude --bg` and a folderless project would just 400; it defaults to
  the project currently in focus (App's `activeProjectId`, the same value
  the left `Sidebar` highlights) if that project is startable, else the
  first startable project, else empty. Submitting calls
  `spawnProjectAgent` and inserts the returned id straight into the pane
  tree via `insertLeaf`, so the new
  session opens attached immediately instead of waiting for the next list
  poll.
- **Auto Tile** (mesa task 411): a toggle (`agent-sidebar-autotile`) in the
  header actions, next to maximize, visible only while expanded. Off by
  default. While on, an effect keyed on `sessions` (the poll result, not the
  per-render sorted `agents` copy — so it only re-runs when a poll actually
  returns new data) keeps the pane tree in sync with agent state instead of
  requiring a click per open/close: every attachable session (`id !== null`)
  in the ACTIVE or BLOCKED bucket without an open pane gets one
  (`insertLeaf`), and every open pane whose session has reached DONE — or has
  left the list — gets closed (`ptyPool.remove` + `removeLeaf`); blocked
  sessions auto-open too, not just working ones, since a blocked agent is the
  one most likely waiting on the user. Because this keys off `bucketOf`, the
  close signal moves with the active rule above (task 861): a `failed` or
  stuck-`working` session stays tiled, a `done` one does not.
  The effect depends on `autoTile` itself, so switching it on syncs
  immediately against whatever `sessions` already holds rather than only
  reacting to future transitions; switching it off just stops the sync — it
  never force-closes panes auto-tile had opened. Interactive sessions
  (`id === null`) are skipped, same as everywhere else in the sidebar — there
  is no pane to open for them.

  **While on, Auto Tile owns the layout** (mesa task 466): the tree is
  rebuilt as a grid (`buildGrid`) rather than patched pane-by-pane, because
  adding a 4th agent to a 3-pane row has to re-tile everything to reach 2x2.
  Column count comes from `gridColumns(n, width, height)` — it scores every
  column count whose cells clear `MIN_GRID_PANE_PX` (360px, below which a
  terminal wraps into slivers) by how far the resulting cell aspect sits from
  a target of 1.4 on a log scale, plus a small penalty per empty grid slot,
  and takes the best. So a 448px-wide sidebar still stacks vertically no
  matter how many agents run, a ~1400px one puts 4 panes in 2x2 and 6 in 3x2,
  and 2 panes go side by side. Leaves fill row-major (pane `i` → column
  `i % cols`), ordered oldest-first, so a newly started agent appends to the
  end instead of shuffling every existing pane one cell along.

  The width/height fed to `gridColumns` is the **tile area's live measured
  rect** (a `ResizeObserver` on `agent-sidebar-tile-area` → `tileSize`), not
  the sidebar's `width` state: that box is resized three independent ways
  (sidebar drag, maximize, list-rail collapse/resize), so a `width`-derived
  guess would be wrong in most of them. The rebuild is skipped unless the
  pane set or the column count actually changed (`autoTileColsRef`), so
  dragging the sidebar a few px wider — or a poll that returns the same
  agents — leaves the user's own divider positions and manual rearrangement
  intact. A manual drag does get overwritten the next time an agent starts
  or finishes; that is the trade the mode asks for, and turning Auto Tile off
  freezes the layout as-is.

  Because of that guard, panes opened **by hand** while the mode is on (a
  list-rail click, or `+ agent`) must re-tile rather than root-append, and
  both go through `addPane` for exactly that reason: `insertLeaf` would drop
  the new leaf in as a full-height extra column of the row-oriented grid, and
  the next poll — seeing a pane set that already matches the sessions list —
  would leave it that way indefinitely. `addPane` rebuilds the grid with the
  new id appended, which is also what makes a `+ agent` pane appear tiled
  immediately instead of on the next poll.

## Live-agent marker on Board cards

A kanban card pulses while a live Claude Code session looks like it is working
on that task (mesa task 663) — so the Board shows *live activity*, not just
stored status. The signal is the same `listAllAgents()` feed the sidebar polls
(3s, riding the server's existing 2s cache — an open board adds no extra
`claude agents --json` cost), passed down from `ProjectTasksPage` into
`KanbanBoard` and matched per card by `liveAgentCount()` in
`frontend/src/boardView.ts`.

Deliberately **not** a stored status: `in_progress` is already conveyed by the
column, and it goes stale when an agent crashes. So the marker fires in every
column, and an `in_progress` row whose agent is gone does not animate.

- **Match rule:** a session belongs to a task when its `name` is exactly
  `"{project.name}: {task.name}"` — the string the todo watcher spawns with
  (`src/api.rs`). The frontend holds both halves and reconstructs it.
- **Liveness** is the existing `isRunningAgent()` (`agentProject.ts`), the same
  predicate the sidebar's bucketing uses: a matching session on the list
  animates its card whatever `state` it reports (task 858) except `done`
  (task 861), and `pid: null` — or the session leaving the list — leaves the
  card still. There is no second liveness predicate.
- **Best-effort by construction**, and it must always degrade to *no
  animation*: sidebar `+ agent` sessions carry no `--name`
  (`DEFAULT_AGENT_SPAWN` has no `{name}`) and never match; a replaced
  `todo-watcher` template without `{name}` loses the marker
  and nothing else; editing a task's `description` after dispatch changes the
  derived `name` and lapses the match; and two tasks in one project sharing
  their first 50 chars both animate. There is no task↔session column,
  migration or route to firm this up — it is a decoration.
- **Degradation:** `/api/agents` is gated and returns 502 `unavailable` with no
  `claude` binary. That error is never read or surfaced; before the first poll
  lands, and on any failure, the board renders exactly as it did before this
  feature — no marker, no banner, no console noise.
- Rendering: a `.live-dot.on` (the existing CC-dashboard live language) in
  `CardBody`, so the `DragOverlay` copy carries it too; tooltip `N agent(s)
  working`. Under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` the dot stays and
  only the pulse stops.
- Covered by vitest (`boardView.test.ts`) plus live QA; no CLI/API/db surface
  changed, so no `scripts/*-check.sh` gate moves.

## Headline cards (mesa task 1484)

Each session row is a card led by one sentence of what it is doing, with the
rest on one faint meta line (`name · kind · model · task or workspace · uptime
· ctx · N running below`) and its children nested underneath.

- **Headline** (`agentRow.ts::agentHeadline`): `AgentSession.activity` — the
  in-progress `activeForm` of the newest `TodoWrite`, else the newest tool-call
  `description` in the transcript tail (`cc::pulse_from_text`) — else the latest
  assistant prose.
- **Task link**: `AgentSession.taskId`/`taskName`, set by `agents::attach_tasks`
  from the task whose `owner` is the session id (`Store::find_task_by_owner`).
  Most sessions claim under another owner, so the card then shows the workspace.
- **Sub-agents** show the `description` from their `.meta.json` sidecar.
- **Shells** are named from the parent's unanswered `Bash` tool calls
  (`agents::pair_shells`): oldest shell with the oldest of the newest N pending
  calls, where the pool is the session's own pending calls **and** every running
  subagent's, merged by the dispatch `timestamp` of their transcript lines (a
  call with no timestamp sorts last, ties keep pool order: the session first,
  then subagents by path). A `run_in_background` Bash call gets its `tool_result` at once, so it is
  never pending: a background shell can be left unpaired or mis-paired with
  another pending call. `AgentChild.description`/`command` carry the result; an unpaired shell
  shows a neutral sentence and no command. Nesting is always under the session,
  since a `ps` row cannot say whether a subagent launched it.

## Default card view and the pinned live agent (mesa task 1491)

- **Opens as full-width cards.** `AgentSidebar` starts with the list rail
  maximized (`agentLive.ts::defaultListMaximized`, off on the phone tier, which
  keeps its own one-pane layout), and `App` folds the main panel (task 1485) on
  the edge where the panel goes from collapsed to open, so the cards span the
  row. Clicking a card opens its pane as before (`togglePane` already
  un-maximizes); the fold and maximize can each still be undone by hand.
- **The live conversation's agent is pinned** above the buckets with no section
  header, in violet (`.agent-card-live`). It is found by `LiveSession.agent_id`
  (from `GET /api/live`, polled beside the list; `liveAgentId` needs
  `status: live`) matching `AgentSession.id` — the id a handoff rebinds, so it
  is always the current driver. No live session, or a job `claude agents` does
  not list, and there is no card.
- **No state badge on it**: the dot is fixed violet, and `waitingFor` shows only
  when `state` is `blocked` on a permission prompt (`liveCardWait`, the same
  notion as `agents::blocked`, mesa task 1293).
