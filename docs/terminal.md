# Terminal (shell panes)

The **Terminal** page is a global nav entry (`#/terminal`,
left `Sidebar` link next to Inbox) showing a pane-tree of real interactive
shells — plain `$SHELL` processes at `~/.mesa/workspace`, not `claude attach`
sessions.
Unlike Agents, there is no server-side session registry: every websocket
connection to the backend endpoint spawns a **new** shell process and dies
with it, and the client owns the pane tree's shape entirely in its own state.
Mounted once, permanently, in `App.tsx` — never resolved into `<main>` — so
navigating to another page and back never disturbs an open pane.

- `GET /api/terminal/attach?cols=<u16>&rows=<u16>[&project=<i64>]` upgrades to
  a **WebSocket bridged onto a real shell in a PTY** (`terminal_attach` in
  `src/api.rs`, `portable-pty`): server→client binary frames are raw terminal
  output; client→server binary frames are keystrokes, text frames are JSON
  control (`{"resize":{cols,rows}}`) — the exact same wire protocol as
  `/api/agents/{id}/attach`, since both now share one `pump_pty` helper.
  Spawn command resolution: `$SHELL` env var, falling back to `/bin/sh`;
  `TERM=xterm-256color`. No path id — each connection is its own shell, so
  there's nothing to select. Closing the socket (from either side) kills that
  connection's shell process only; other open panes are unaffected.
- **cwd is `~/.mesa/workspace`, or a project's folder with `?project=<id>`**
  (the project Terminal tab, below). The workspace is `config::workspace_dir()`,
  created on demand: Claude Code never persists folder trust for the home
  directory, so Naru owns one folder instead. The path is never
  client-supplied: the id is resolved
  through the store to that project's `local_path`, and rejected exactly as
  the agents list route resolves its folder — unknown id is
  `not_found`, unset or non-directory `local_path` is `validation` (422).
  Both fail the handshake *before* the upgrade, so a bad scope never spawns a
  shell somewhere the caller didn't ask for. This adds no new reachability:
  the gate below is unchanged, and any caller that clears it can already run
  `cd <anywhere>` in a workspace shell.
- **Shares `require_agent_access` verbatim with the Agents attach
  endpoint** — same gate, same call shape, no new/weaker/stronger logic; see
  `docs/agents.md`'s "All four agent routes share..." writeup for the full
  loopback/Host/Origin stack and its `--lan` behavior, which applies here
  unchanged (a non-agent route reusing the same gate). The one thing worth
  restating for this surface specifically: a raw shell is a materially
  different *shape* of code execution than a scoped `claude attach <id>`
  bridge, but not a different *reachability class* — any peer that already
  clears this gate under `--lan` can reach unconstrained code execution today
  via `POST /api/projects/{id}/agents` (`claude --bg`), so gate-parity here
  isn't granting a new class of access, just a different shell for the same
  already-gated caller.
- One posture note worth calling out explicitly: because the Terminal page is
  always mounted (below) and seeds one shell pane by default, a workspace shell
  spawns on **every app load, on any route** — not only once the user
  actually navigates to `#/terminal`. It's gated by the exact same
  `require_agent_access` check as ever; what's changed is that reaching the
  gate no longer requires an explicit "open Terminal" click first.
- No new error codes — denials are `require_agent_access`'s existing
  `validation`/403 shapes, unchanged.

## Pane-tree UI

Panes live in the same split-tree model as the Agent sidebar
(`frontend/src/lib/paneTree.ts`, extracted out of `AgentSidebar.tsx` and
shared by both surfaces) — a leaf is one pane, a split is an ordered list of
children each carrying a `ratio` and an orientation (`row`/`column`). The
Terminal page seeds one shell leaf on mount; since only a drag-to-split
creates new leaves in the shared tree engine and there's no session picker to
open one from, a page-header `+ new shell` button mints and appends a fresh
leaf directly to root (the one deliberate addition beyond the tree engine
itself). Resize (divider drag), split (drag a pane onto another's edge), and
rearrange (drag a pane's grip to reorder within its split, or to another
split's center to move across) work identically to the Agent sidebar's model
— see `docs/agents.md`'s "Layout" section for the full drag/drop-zone
mechanics, which this page reuses unchanged. Each pane's shell lifecycle is
independent: opening several panes runs distinct, concurrently-progressing
shells, and a pane's explicit **close** button kills only its own process,
leaving every other open pane's process and output untouched.

**Pane font stack.** Every embedded terminal — Terminal-page panes, the
per-project Terminal tab, and the Agent sidebar's `claude attach` panes —
renders through the one xterm.js component `PtyTerminal.tsx`, which is the
**only** place the family list is named: `"Share Tech Mono", "Pure Nerd Font",
Menlo, monospace`. Share Tech Mono stays primary so ordinary text looks exactly
as it did; the second family is an icons-only Nerd Font (v3 symbol set) that
supplies only the Private Use Area codepoints Share Tech Mono lacks, so a
starship/p10k prompt's git, branch and folder glyphs draw as icons instead of
tofu. The font is bundled from the `@azurity/pure-nerd-font` dependency and
imported in `frontend/src/main.tsx` beside the two `@fontsource` imports — never
a CDN, because the UI is embedded in the binary and must render offline; Vite
emits the hashed `.woff2` into `frontend/dist/assets/`, where rust-embed picks
it up like the other font files. Font *size* is unrelated and stays the
CSS-driven `--pty-font-size` breakpoint (`docs/mobile.md`).

**Cross-nav persistence.** `TerminalPage` is mounted exactly once in
`App.tsx`, as a permanent sibling of `<main>`'s router outlet (not a branch of
the route-conditional `page` variable that resolves into `<main>` and
unmounts on every navigation) — the same pattern the Agent sidebar already
uses. Whichever of `<main>`/`<TerminalPage>` isn't the active route is
toggled with `visibility: hidden`, never `display: none` and never a
conditional render, since a `display:none` box collapses to zero size and
breaks `FitAddon.fit()`'s layout read for any pane resized while hidden (a
browser-window resize while the user is on a different page, for instance).
The result: navigating away from Terminal and back leaves every open pane's
websocket, PTY, and xterm scrollback completely untouched — no reconnect, no
PTY restart, verified via `ps` (same PIDs before/after) and a live command
(e.g. `sleep 300`) continuing exactly where it was.

**A pane's flex chain must carry `min-width: 0`, not just `min-height: 0`**
(mesa task 552). `.agent-terminal` and `.agent-terminal-screen` — the two
boxes `PtyTerminal` renders, shared by this page and the Agent sidebar — are
flex items, and a flex item defaults to `min-width: auto`, i.e. it refuses to
shrink below its content's min-content width. An xterm's content is a
character grid, so its min-content width is `cols × cell width`: when the
surrounding layout gets *narrower*, the box stays pinned at the old size,
`FitAddon.fit()` measures that stale width (it reads
`terminal.element.parentElement`), derives a cols count still too large, and
xterm re-lays-out — which resizes the box again and re-fires the
`ResizeObserver` that called `fit()`. The loop walks the terminal down two
columns per frame until it reaches the true fit, sending one
`{"resize":…}` frame per step: **89 frames measured from a single
un-maximize click**, i.e. 89 SIGWINCHes into the attached process. A raw
shell shrugs that off; the `claude attach` bridge does not — Claude Code's
Ink TUI redraws its prompt box on every one, which surfaced as the input box
steadily gaining line breaks. With `min-width: 0` on both boxes the same
click sends exactly 1. Both are required: `.agent-terminal-screen` alone
still stormed at 89, since its own parent still refused to shrink. The
mirror of the `display: none` trap above — that one collapses the measured
box to zero, this one pins it too wide.

**At the phone tier there is no split at all** (mesa task 560). Both this page
and the Agent sidebar render a single pane below 600px — `SoloShellPane` here,
`SoloAgentPane` there, plain siblings of the sortable versions rather than a
prop on them, since `useSortable` requires an enclosing `DndContext` and the
whole point is that there isn't one. `+ new shell` is not rendered, so the
tree cannot grow past the seeded leaf.

The tree itself is **not** pruned to match. The unrendered leaves keep their
sockets open in `PtyPool` with their containers detached, exactly as a leaf is
for one commit mid-reparent, so widening past 600px restores the layout with
every shell's scrollback intact (verified with distinct per-pane markers across
a 1440 → 390 → 1440 round trip). Pruning would have to kill them, and — as the
`PtySlot`/`PtyPool` section below says — a shell killed on this surface is
unrecoverable. This is also why it cannot be a CSS rule: `display: none` on a
live pane is the same zero-size-box trap the `visibility` toggle above avoids.
See `docs/mobile.md` for the rest, including the on-screen-keyboard sizing and
the measured frame counts.

**Counting a pane's outbound resize frames.** The measurement behind mesa task
552's number, and the one any change to the resize path owes: hook the socket
from inside the page and read `window.__sent`.

```js
const o = WebSocket.prototype.send
window.__sent = []
WebSocket.prototype.send = function (d) {
  window.__sent.push({ t: Math.round(performance.now()),
    s: typeof d === 'string' ? 'TEXT:' + d : 'BIN' })
  return o.apply(this, arguments)
}
```

Text frames are the `{"resize":{cols,rows}}` controls; binary frames are
keystrokes. A healthy transition sends **one** text frame per live PTY. A
climbing sequence (`…,52,54,55,56`) is `FitAddon` converging — expected after a
font-size change, and the signature of the task-552 feedback loop if it appears
after a plain width change.

**Surviving a split or move, not just navigation.** A drag-to-edge split or a
cross-split move reparents a leaf under a freshly-minted split-node id, which
would otherwise remount every leaf in that subtree — including its live
terminal — since React's keyed reconciliation only compares siblings within
one parent's array. Each pane's terminal is therefore never rendered directly
at its tree position; instead it's portaled once into a stable, pool-owned
DOM container (`frontend/src/lib/ptyPool.ts` + the always-mounted `PtyPool`
component + a `PtySlot` placeholder at each tree position, shared verbatim
with the Agent sidebar) that a tree position merely relocates via
`appendChild` whenever it mounts there. Only an explicit pane close removes
an entry from the pool; a plain reparent never does, so splitting or moving
an already-running pane preserves its process, scrollback, and cursor state
exactly as if it had never moved. This mechanism is what makes the Terminal
page's split/move safe at all (there is no backing session to reconnect to,
unlike `claude attach` — a killed shell here is unrecoverable), and it fixed
the Agent sidebar's own equivalent scrollback-loss issue as an incidental
consequence of being shared.

## Project Terminal tab

`#/projects/:id/terminal` is the same `TerminalPage` component rendered as a
project tab beside Files, with its shells rooted in that project's
`local_path` instead of `~/.mesa/workspace`. One optional `projectId` prop is
the whole difference: it picks the endpoint (`?project=<id>`, so the *server* resolves
the folder) and the scope key. Everything else — the tree engine, the
drag/split/resize model, `PtySlot`/`PtyPool`, `+ new shell` — is the global
page's code unchanged.

- **Every scope keeps its own pane tree**, in a module-level `Map` in
  `TerminalPage.tsx` keyed `global` / `project:<id>`. Unlike the global page,
  the tab is inside `<main>`'s routed content and therefore *unmounts* when
  you switch tabs. The panes' shells survive that on their own (they live in
  the always-mounted `PtyPool`, and a detached pool container is relocated,
  never recreated) — but the tree's *shape* is plain component state, which
  would reset to one fresh leaf and orphan every still-running pane. The map
  is what closes that gap; `ProjectTasksPage` renders the page with
  `key={`project-${projectId}`}` so switching projects is a fresh mount that
  restores the new scope's own tree. There is deliberately **no**
  second permanent mount and no `visibility` toggle for this surface: the
  pool already provides the process-level persistence that motivated the
  global page's permanent mount.
- **Sizing**: the embedded page adds `.terminal-page-embedded`, which drops
  the standalone padding/scroll and binds the pane body to the same
  `--tab-viewport-*` box the Files/Agents layouts use — inside the project
  frame's block flow, `flex: 1` has nothing to grow against and the panes
  would otherwise collapse to zero height. Above 860px that box is no longer
  the window: the project frame is a `height: 100%` flex column there and
  rebinds `--tab-viewport-*` to the room the title and tab strip leave (task
  875), so the shell reaches the bottom of the project view rather than
  stopping 18rem short of it. At the phone tier this box drops
  `--tab-viewport-min`'s 256px floor and hides its own
  `.terminal-page-header`: with an on-screen keyboard up the tab has 112px to
  work with, and the floor alone put the prompt back under the keyboard
  (`docs/mobile.md`). The global page keeps its header.
- **A project with no `local_path`** shows the Files/Git tabs' "no linked
  folder" placeholder instead of a pane tree, so the dead case is a quiet
  empty state, not a socket that opens and immediately closes. A
  `local_path` that is set but no longer a directory is left to the server's
  own `validation` rejection (the pane shows its "shell closed" banner) —
  there's no tree/status call on this tab to read that rung from.
- The `'a'` create-task shortcut reaches this tab like every other project
  view (task 811), and `shouldIgnoreShortcut`'s `.xterm`/`.agent-terminal`
  rule is now the only thing standing between it and a keystroke meant for a
  shell — it used to be the second of two, behind a Board-only listener. A
  typed `a` still lands in the pane; `a` with focus outside every pane opens
  the create-task modal over the tab, which is the point.
