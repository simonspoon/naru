# Keyboard shortcuts

Global keyboard control of the web UI: a create-task shortcut on any project
view, and an app-wide spatial focus layer driven by `h/j/k/l` and the arrow
keys. Frontend-only except for where the bindings are **stored** — since mesa
task 1079 the five global listeners read a **keymap** the user can rebind from
Settings, which lives in `~/.mesa/config.json`'s `keymap` section
(`docs/config.md`). Nothing in Rust *reads* it: the shortcuts are still the
page's.

## Bindings

| Key | Action | Scope | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `a` | `create-task` | any project view | Opens the create-task modal **in place**, over the view you are on (task 811) |
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | `focus-*` | global | Move native DOM focus left / down / up / right |
| `←` `↓` `↑` `→` | `focus-*` | global | Same as `hjkl` |
| `Enter` | — | global | Activates the focused element (native browser behavior) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` | `command-palette` | global | Command palette |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+L` | `live-listen` | global | Opens and shuts the microphone during a live conversation (task 887) |
| `Escape` | `live-cancel` | live conversation, joined | Drops what the microphone heard and has not sent, and mutes it; again to resume its own mute (task 1354, `docs/live.md`) — any other Escape owner wins |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+F` | — | Files tab, focused pane, findable file | Opens find-in-file, selecting the remembered query (task 809) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` | — | Files tab | Opens the project-wide search panel in place of the tree, selecting the remembered query (task 813) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+S` | — | Files tab editor | Saves the file, staying in the editor (and swallows Save Page) |
| `Alt+W` | — | Files tab | Closes the focused pane's active tab |
| `Alt+[` `Alt+]` | — | Files tab | Previous / next tab in the focused pane |

The **Action** column is the keymap action id: a row that has one is
**rebindable** from Settings → Keyboard shortcuts, and the chord shown is only
its default (see "The keymap" below). A row with `—` is not, and is not meant
to be.

`Enter` is deliberately *not* special-cased. Focus lands on real interactive
elements, so the browser's own activation does the right thing: a link
navigates, a button clicks, an `InlineEdit` label opens its editor. "Does
nothing on a non-actionable element" falls out for free — non-interactive
elements are never focusable, so they never receive focus to begin with.

`a` was Board-only until task 811, and gaining the other views changed *how* it
opens, not just *where*: it now sets `ProjectTasksPage`'s own `creating` state
instead of navigating to `#/projects/:id/create-task`. That route renders the
**Board** underneath the form, which is the right landing place for the command
palette's "Create task in &lt;project&gt;" entry (its only remaining caller) and
exactly the wrong one for this shortcut — a task written while reading a file,
a diff or a diagram would have thrown away the thing it was about. The
in-place modal leaves the view untouched, and is draggable and lightly dimmed
for the same reason (`modalDrag.ts`, `CreateTaskModal.tsx`).

It is the one shortcut bound on **`keyup`** rather than `keydown` (task 817).
The modal it opens autoFocuses its description textarea, and React flushes a
discrete event synchronously — so opening on `keydown` mounted that textarea
while the keystroke was still in flight, and the rest of the keystroke typed an
`a` into the empty description. Waiting for `keyup` lets the whole keystroke
land on the (non-editable) view first. Anything that opens a focused text
control from a printable key needs the same treatment; `preventDefault()` is
not a substitute.

The listener is bound app-wide with no view check, because
`shouldIgnoreShortcut` already answers the question every non-Board view would
have asked: the Files editor and the new-file row are text controls (rule 2),
the Terminal tab's panes are xterm (rule 3), a diagram canvas suppresses
everything (rule 4). Do not re-add a per-view gate on top of it — that is the
divergent second suppression check the chokepoint exists to prevent.

## The keymap (task 1079)

`frontend/src/keymap.ts` is the one table of what Naru binds, and the one place
a keystroke is read against it. Before it, each listener compared `e.key`
inline — the palette in `App.tsx`, the spatial nav's `KEY_DIRECTION`, the `a`
shortcut in `ProjectTasksPage`, the listen chord's `isListenChord` — so there
was nowhere to *state* what Naru binds and nothing to rebind.

- **Eight actions**, exactly the five global `window` keydown listeners:
  `command-palette`, the four `focus-*` directions, `create-task`,
  `live-listen` and `live-cancel` (task 1354). Component-local bindings stay hard-coded — the Files tab's
  chords, the code editor's Cmd/Ctrl+S and a modal's Escape belong to one panel
  while it is on screen, which is a different thing from a binding the whole
  app answers to. Rebinding those would be rebinding a form.
- **An action holds a list of chords**, because the spatial nav has always
  answered to a letter *and* an arrow. A recording replaces the list with the
  one chord recorded.
- **A chord is `Mod+Alt+Shift+<key>`**, modifiers in that order, `Mod` being
  meta-**or**-ctrl so one keymap means the same thing on either platform. The
  key is whatever `KeyboardEvent.key` reports, lowercased when it is a single
  character; `canonicalChord` is the one spelling, and every comparison —
  matching, conflict detection, "is this still the default" — goes through it.
- **`matchesShortcut(action, event, keymap)` is what every listener calls**,
  and it is where `shouldIgnoreShortcut` is now consulted: **a matched chord
  carrying no modifier is subject to it, wherever it is bound.** With the
  shipped defaults that is byte-identical to the four inline checks it replaced
  (exactly the bare chords — `h/j/k/l`, the arrows, `a` — consulted it before).
  It has to be a rule about the chord rather than the call site because a user
  may now bind `create-task` to Cmd+Shift+N, which must fire from inside a text
  field as the palette does, or the palette to `p`, which must not be typed
  into one.
- **All three modifiers are compared exactly.** That is a hair stricter than
  what it replaced: `Shift+←` used to move focus left, since the old table only
  looked at `e.key`. Deliberate — a recording round-trips exactly, and two
  chords differing only by a modifier are genuinely two chords, which is what
  makes the conflict rule mean anything.
- **A chord belongs to one action.** `conflicts()` is the editor's inline
  complaint and the save's refusal; `config::check_no_chord_collision` is the
  server refusing the same thing, judged against the whole map a save would
  leave behind — including the actions the user never touched.
- **`keymapStore.ts` is the one fetch.** One `GET /api/config/keymap` per page
  however many listeners ask, the shipped chords in force until it answers (so
  a refused or unreadable config leaves the app with shortcuts rather than
  none), and a Settings save publishes its own response straight to the
  listeners so a rebind takes effect with no reload.
- The command palette shows the chord for any row that *is* a keymap action,
  read from the same store — so the palette and the keyboard can never
  disagree. Rows that are plain navigation show nothing; an invented chord
  would be worse than none.

Unit tests: `frontend/src/keymap.test.ts` (defaults, matching, recording,
conflicts, the resolve fallback) and `frontend/src/keymapDraft.test.ts` (the
Settings editor's draft). The shipped table is pinned on both sides —
`the shipped keymap` there and
`config::tests::the_shipped_keymap_is_todays_behaviour` here — so editing one
without the other fails.

## The suppression chokepoint

**`shouldIgnoreShortcut(e: KeyboardEvent): boolean`** in
`frontend/src/keyboardScope.ts` is the single gate for every global
single-key shortcut. Since task 1079 its caller is `keymap.ts`'s
`matchesShortcut`, on behalf of all five global listeners, whenever the matched
chord carries no modifier — so every bare shortcut still consumes it, through
one call instead of four.

**Any new global single-key shortcut MUST call it** — in practice, by going
through `matchesShortcut`. Do not hand-roll a second suppression check, and do
not fork this module — a divergent copy is how one surface starts eating
another's keys.

Returns `true` (suppress) for, in order:

1. A modifier chord is held (`metaKey`/`ctrlKey`/`altKey`) — those belong to
   their existing owners, e.g. the command palette.
2. `e.target.closest(...)` matches a text input, `textarea`,
   `contenteditable`, or a native `select` — typing and native select
   option-cycling/type-ahead win. A **function key (F1–F24) is exempt from
   this rule alone** (mesa task 1268): it produces no text, so the reason for
   standing a bare shortcut down inside a field does not apply, and a shortcut
   rebound to one fires wherever the caret sits — a bare letter is suppressed
   there exactly as before. The other exemption is `claimedFrom` (task 1354): a
   caller may name the **one** text control its shortcut is still claimed
   from — `keymap.ts`'s `CLAIMED_FROM`, today only `live-cancel`'s Escape in
   the live capture box (`.live-input`), so it still fires when the person is
   typing in the capture box, into which Escape types nothing. `matchesShortcut`
   passes it only for a key that types nothing (`e.key` longer than one
   character), so a printable rebind is stood down in the box like anywhere
   else. Rules 3–5 still apply there.
3. `e.target.closest('.xterm, .agent-terminal')` — xterm panes read real
   `keydown` events.
4. A diagram canvas is mounted anywhere on the page (`.diagram`) — it
   owns its own key handling and is its own spatial surface.
5. A modal that owns its own key handling is open
   (`.create-task-backdrop`, `.command-palette-backdrop`).
   `.create-task-backdrop` is the **shared** backdrop class, not one modal's:
   create-task, create-project and task detail (`TaskModal.tsx`) all mount it,
   so all three suppress the global shortcuts while open. A new modal that
   reuses it inherits that for free; one that invents its own backdrop class
   must be added to rule 5 here and in `keyboardScope.ts`.

Rules 4 and 5 are **document-wide** queries, not `closest()` — nothing inside
those surfaces is focusable, so the keydown target never lands inside them.

> **Consequence — do not leave a modal's DOM mounted after it closes.**
> Because rule 5 is document-wide, a lingering `.create-task-backdrop`
> silently kills *every* global shortcut until a full page reload. This
> actually happened: `ProjectTasksPage`'s create-panel sync was one-way
> (`if (createTask) setCreating(true)`), so browser Back off the
> `create-task` route left the panel mounted on a board route. Fixed by
> making the sync two-way. If shortcuts ever go dead app-wide, check for a
> stale backdrop first.

## The chord sibling (`shouldIgnoreFilesShortcut`, task 809)

`shouldIgnoreShortcut`'s **first** rule is "a modifier chord belongs to its
existing owner", so it answers `true` for every chord by construction — a chord
shortcut cannot consult it, and must not be the reason someone weakens it. The
Files tab's chords therefore call a *sibling* export in the same file,
**`shouldIgnoreFilesShortcut(e, chord)`**, so there is still exactly one module
deciding which surface may claim a keystroke.

One predicate for all five chords, not one each: they ask nearly the same
question. It returns `true` (stand down) when a modal that owns its own keys is
open (`.create-task-backdrop`, `.command-palette-backdrop` — rule 5 above, same
classes) or when the caret is in a text control that is not the tab's own. The
editor (`.files-content-editor`) claims every one of them — finding text in, or
closing, the file you are editing is what they exist for. Which *other* boxes a
chord survives is one table in the module (`CHORD_FIELDS`), and it is the only
place the chords part company: `'find'` keeps `.files-find-input`, `'search'`
keeps that one *and* `.files-search-input`, `'tabs'` keeps neither. The `chord`
argument (`'find'` | `'search'` | `'tabs'`, required, never defaulted) is how a
caller says which it is, rather than inheriting whichever answer happened to be
the default.

The reason they differ is what each does to the box in question. Cmd/Ctrl+F acts
*in* the find bar's query box, and Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F acts in its own (and
escalating from the in-file bar to the project is the natural move, so it is
claimed from both). Alt+W and Alt+[ / ] act by tearing the bar down — the pane's
active path changes, `ContentPane` remounts, and the input is unmounted while it
holds focus, which drops focus on `<body>` (Tab restarts at the top of the page,
Escape answers nothing). `closeFind` hands the caret on for exactly that reason
and the tab chords have nothing to hand it to, the pane that would take it not
existing yet, so they stand down there instead. Everything else about scoping is
the caller's: the
listeners live in `FilesView`/`ContentPane`, so they exist only while the tab
is mounted, and Cmd/Ctrl+F additionally requires that pane to be the focused
one — in a split, both are mounted and two find bars racing for one keystroke
is the bug scoping avoids. Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F is `FilesView`'s for the opposite
reason: the panel is the tab's, not a file's, so there is no pane to be focused
and nothing to race.

**`preventDefault` fires only after a binding has decided to act**, which is
what keeps the browser's own Cmd+F everywhere else and leaves an Alt chord this
tab does nothing with (a one-tab pane's `Alt+]`) alone. The tab chords match on
**`e.code`**, not `e.key`: Alt+W on macOS *is* the character `∑`.

**Which is also the price, and it is paid in the editor.** On macOS Option+W,
Option+`[` and Option+`]` are `∑`, `“` and `‘`, and the predicate deliberately
lets these chords through in `.files-content-editor` — closing or cycling the
file you are *editing* is the case they exist for. So with the caret in the code
and something for the chord to do, those three characters do not type; with one
tab open `Alt+[`/`Alt+]` stand down (nothing to cycle to) and `“`/`‘` type
normally, so the behaviour depends on how many tabs are open. That is the trade
rather than an oversight: Alt is the only chord space this page owns (Cmd/Ctrl+W
and Ctrl+Tab are the browser's, below), and losing a curly quote in a code
editor is the smaller loss. Elsewhere in the app — and in any other text control,
where the predicate stands down — all three still type.

**Cmd/Ctrl+W is deliberately not bound.** Chrome and Safari deliver it to the
browser, not the document, so binding it would ship a shortcut that works
nowhere and loses the window; Ctrl+Tab and Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+`[`/`]` are skipped
for the same reason, which is why the bindings are Alt-based.

Inside the editor itself, Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/brackets are *editing* keys
rather than shortcuts and never reach either predicate — `CodeEditor` returns
before consulting `editorInput.ts` the moment any of `meta`/`ctrl`/`alt` is
held, and before anything at all while an IME composition is in flight
(`isComposing`, the keydown that commits a candidate). Escape is claimed by both
the find bar and the editor and is resolved by
precedence, not by focus: with the bar up Escape closes the bar, and only once
it is gone does it discard the edit. In **view** mode there is no editor to
route it, so the pane binds Escape at the document level while the bar is up —
otherwise clicking one of the bar's own buttons left the key answered by
nothing. The close-confirm bar (task 809, the tab's one modal-ish prompt) binds
Escape on itself for the same reason it autofocuses "keep editing": both keys a
user reaches for to dismiss a prompt have to resolve it, and both resolve it the
safe way. It stops the event rather than letting it bubble, since the editor
underneath answers Escape by discarding the very draft the bar is protecting.

**Escape also arms the next Tab as a plain focus move**, in either mode and in
every mount of this editor (`tabEscapeAfter`). Taking Tab away from the browser
takes the last keyboard route out of an indented line with it — Shift+Tab falls
through only once there is nothing left to dedent — which is a WCAG 2.1.2 trap,
and worst on the Scripts page, where the same component is one field of a form
and nothing binds Escape at all. Any other typed key disarms it, so a user who
presses Escape and keeps typing never sees it.

**Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F is the project search** (task 813), and the find binding
still excludes Shift. That was the point of the exclusion: the chord means "find
in files" everywhere it is bound, so swallowing it to open the *in-file* bar
would have been claiming a key this tab was never offered — while the tab now
has the surface the chord actually names, and takes it for that.

Its listener is `FilesView`'s, not a pane's, because the panel belongs to the
tab rather than to a file: there is no focused-pane condition and nothing for a
split to race. It stands down through the same `shouldIgnoreFilesShortcut`, as
`'search'`, which is claimed from the editor and from *either* query box — the
find bar's and its own — since a second Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F is "select what I
typed" and escalating from one bar to the other is the natural move. Unlike the
tab chords it has somewhere deliberate to put the caret afterwards (its own
input), which is why the hand-off argument that stands those down does not apply
here.

**Escape in the panel is bound on the panel**, not on `document` — the one place
this feature deviates from the find bar's shape, and deliberately. The panel
sits *beside* the file rather than over it, so the editor's Escape (discard the
edit) and the find bar's (close the bar) have to keep working while it is open;
a React `onKeyDown` on the panel's own wrapper answers the key exactly when
focus is inside it. Closing hands the caret to the tree pane's search toggle —
a real control that outlives the panel, the same rule `closeFind` follows.

## Focus candidates

Native focusability **is** the whole candidate contract — any element already
in the tab order. No registry, no per-component opt-in. `tabindex="-1"` opts
an element out.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Kanban cards.** dnd-kit injects `role="button"`/`tabIndex={0}` onto the
  card `<li>` to serve a `KeyboardSensor` this board never configures. That
  made the `<li>` a dead second tab stop ahead of the real target. It is
  forced back to `tabIndex={-1}`, so the tab stop — and the spatial-nav
  candidate — is the nested `<a href="#/projects/:id/tasks/:id">`, which
  already opens the task on Enter natively.
- **`InlineEdit`** was a bare `<span onClick>` — not keyboard-reachable at
  all. It now carries `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, and an Enter handler.

Candidates must also pass a **visibility** test: a non-zero rect *plus* a
computed `visibility` check. Naru keeps live-resource panes mounted-but-hidden
via `visibility: hidden` rather than unmounting them (the inactive
main/Terminal pane, the collapsed AgentSidebar body) so their WebSockets
survive navigation. Those still report a positive-area rect, and `focus()` on
them silently no-ops — without the visibility check, navigation dead-ends in
that direction.

## Geometry

`frontend/src/spatialNav.ts` picks the nearest candidate by on-screen
bounding box, **not DOM/tab order**:

- Direction filter uses **edge** comparison, not centers — so an element
  can't count as "to the right" while still overlapping the origin on the
  primary axis.
- Score prefers a small gap along the pressed axis, and prefers candidates
  that overlap the origin on the perpendicular axis (two cards in the same
  row overlap vertically for a left/right move).
- **No wrap-around.** Nothing in that direction → focus stays put.
- Cold start (nothing focused yet) has no origin, so the first press picks a
  sensible entry point rather than no-oping.

Matching is on lowercase `e.key`. `e.key`'s case follows Shift, so a shifted
letter is not this feature's concern; arrow-key names don't change with Shift.

## Listeners

Four `window` listeners, each reading its own action out of the keymap it is
handed: `useCommandPaletteShortcut` and `useSpatialNav()` side by side in
`App.tsx`, `useCreateTaskShortcut` inside `ProjectTasksPage` (mounted with the
page, so it is inert by construction where the page is not — no route-string
comparison involved), and the listen chord's own listener in `LiveHub`. Their
key sets are disjoint, which the keymap's conflict rule is now what
guarantees rather than the shipped table happening to be so.

The `a` shortcut is the one bound on **`keyup`** (task 817, above); the other
three are `keydown`. The Settings editor's recording listener is a fifth, on
the **capture** phase, mounted only while a row is recording: it
`stopPropagation`s so the chord being recorded does not also *fire* — pressing
Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P to rebind the palette must not open the palette — and swallows
the matching `keyup` too, since that is the phase `create-task` listens on.

## Verifying changes here

`shouldIgnoreShortcut` itself has unit tests (`npm --prefix frontend run
test`, `frontend/src/keyboardScope.test.ts`) covering each of its five checks
against a jsdom tree. They cover the **decision** and nothing below it: the
test dispatches a synthetic bubbling `keydown` from a chosen element, so it
pins what the predicate answers for a given `e.target` — never that a real
browser would have delivered the keystroke to that target in the first place.
Focus routing, `isTrusted`, and whether a handler is mounted at all are still
only answerable live.

So: drive real keys with `khora key` (CDP `Input.dispatchKeyEvent`) —
synthetic `KeyboardEvent` dispatch is not trusted and won't exercise these
handlers.
`khora key` sends no character, so it cannot test text entry; use
`khora type-keys <session> <selector> <text>` for that.

Verify **each suppression context on its own**. Proving letter-key
suppression does not prove arrow-key suppression: `select` and xterm bind
arrows specifically, letters only incidentally.
