# Work receipts gate (mesa task 920): exercises `mesa task receipt` end to
# end over the CLI, against a throwaway MESA_DB and a REAL throwaway git
# repo bound as a project's local_path (receipts read commits with `git
# log`, so a fake/no-op repo would prove nothing about D4's attribution
# window).
#
# The load-bearing assertions, beyond CRUD shape:
#   * closing a CLAIMED task auto-generates a receipt, and the commits made
#     during the claim window (and only those) appear in it (D1/D3/D4);
#   * closing an UNCLAIMED task generates no receipt at all (D3's guard);
#   * the diff summary counts a file changed by two commits once, not twice
#     (core::git::diff_stat's distinct-paths contract);
#   * --note sets the note and flips edited (D6);
#   * --regenerate PRESERVES a hand-written note/edited while recomputing
#     the machine fields — a regression guard for a real data-loss bug
#     (core::receipt::regenerate's doc comment, "defect 1") where an early
#     version of --regenerate silently discarded a hand-written note;
#   * --quiet drops exactly `commits`/`note`, nothing else (key-set compare
#     via jq, never byte-for-byte);
#   * --delete echoes the destroyed record and a subsequent show is
#     not_found (the recovery-transcript safety floor);
#   * --regenerate on a project with no local_path is validation, exit 1;
#   * mutually exclusive flags together are a usage error, exit 2.
