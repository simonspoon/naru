# API gate: exercises the HTTP task surface end to end against a live
# `mesa serve` on a throwaway MESA_DB — the API-side counterpart to
# `scripts/cli-check.sh`, which is CLI-only and never speaks HTTP.
#
# Covers, in order:
#   1. the security boundary in default mode — the Host-header allowlist and
#      the Content-Type gate (`guard` in src/api.rs), including the
#      `application/json; charset=utf-8` parameter case and the GET carve-out;
#   2. the task routes' JSON contract and status codes — create/list/show/
#      update/delete, the TaskSummary-vs-Task shape split, derived `blocked`,
#      block/unblock/dependencies/dependents and the cycle rejection;
#   3. the claim routes added by task 563 — POST /api/tasks/{id}/claim and
#      /release: 200 shapes, renewal, the 409 on a rival owner, --force, the
#      status-leaves-in_progress clear, and the `claimed_at` asymmetry that
#      makes the pair useful (it must NOT move on an ordinary field write),
#      plus the read-side `?stale_claim_minutes=N` filter added by task 1017;
#   4. archived-project scoping over HTTP (unscoped hides, scoped does not);
#   5. the project `sort_order` round-trip added by task 666 — the field the
#      sidebar's drag-reorder writes, and the list order it drives, plus the
#      `parent_id` surface added by task 668 (nesting, detach, cycle/unknown
#      rejection, the archive cascade and the subtree delete echo);
#   5a3. POST /api/inbox/{id}/archive (task 845) — the archive toggle: stamped
#      once, cleared by the other direction, independent of the read mark, and
#      inside the Content-Type gate;
#   5a4. PATCH /api/inbox/{id} (task 1269) — assign: the created task back, the
#      item left ARCHIVED as `converted-to-task` with `converted_task_id`
#      naming it rather than deleted, and a second PATCH a 409 `conflict`;
#   5b. GET /api/inbox/{id}/speak (task 815) — the audio contract, the patched
#      streaming WAV sizes, the audio arriving *while* it is still being
#      rendered (task 816), the hostile body arriving as stdin data, the
#      `unavailable` failure and the `require_agent_access` gate, driven
#      against a stub `kokoro-rs` (`MESA_KOKORO_BIN`);
#   5c. GET /api/config/speech/preview (task 824) — the Settings page's voice
#      test button: the same audio contract and gate, mesa's own sentence as
#      the spoken text, the *query's* voice as one argv after `-v`, no `-v` at
#      all when it is blank, and a name shaped like an option refused before
#      anything is spawned;
#   6. LAN mode — the Host allowlist is skipped while the Content-Type gate
#      still applies, the two halves of one posture (CLAUDE.md), the speak
#      route keeps its stronger gate through the flip, and `--allow-host`
#      (task 1294) serves exactly the DNS name it was given while every other
#      name, near miss and foreign port stays 403.
#
# Attachment routes have their own gate (scripts/attachments-check.sh); the
# agents/terminal/hook routes have theirs (agents-check.sh, hooks-check.sh).

# 45 KB-per-second TTS model. It logs its stdin verbatim (so the hostile-body
# assertion can read it back) and emits the exact *streaming* WAV header
# `kokoro-rs -o -` writes — both sizes 0xFFFFFFFF — so the response proves
# mesa patched them.
#
# It also models the property task 816 turned on: a real synthesiser writes the
# header first and the audio sentence by sentence over the following seconds.
# Dropping a `slow` file in the stub dir inserts that pause between the two, so
# the gate can prove the header reaches the client while the render is still
