# Mesa-live gate (mesa task 855): exercises the spoken-conversation surface end
# to end — the `mesa live` CLI group and the `/api/live*` routes — against a
# throwaway MESA_DB, a stub `claude` (MESA_CLAUDE_BIN), a stub `kokoro-rs`
# (MESA_KOKORO_BIN) and a stub `loki` (MESA_LOKI_BIN). No real agent, no real
# synthesiser and no real screen are ever touched.
#
# Covers, in order:
#   1. the CLI with nothing running — `status` prints null and exits 0, every
#      other verb is `not_found` naming `mesa live start`, and the usage errors
#      (exit 2) around them, including `--quiet` refused on `turns` and `look`;
#   2. the CLI happy path on a --no-agent session: start -> say -> navigate ->
#      turns -> sidebars -> stop -> status, plus the `--quiet` key sets compared
#      with jq (a turn drops `text`; a session drops nothing);
#   3. every `Validation` rule reachable from a surface — the route shape, the
#      8192-char text bound, a mesa turn with neither text nor action, an
#      unknown project — and the `conflict` that enforces one live session;
#   4. the spawn: project resolution by id AND by name, the `live-agent`
#      template's argv (`--agent naru-live`), the session name and working
#      folder, the prompt arriving as ONE argument and carrying the session
#      line alone (a hostile project name is data, never syntax), the
#      `naru-live` agent definition seeded into $HOME/.claude/agents on the
#      first start and never overwritten after it, and a failed spawn ending
#      the session it opened rather than stranding it;
#   5. the API twin over a live `serve` — the `{session:null,turns:[]}` empty
#      state, start/stop, the 409, the utterance write, the route write and the
#      context riding with it (both halves recorded, the CLI reading back the
#      same context, the three-way context key — omitted keeps, null clears, a
#      value replaces (task 1016) — the closed `kind` vocabulary and the
#      200-char field bound), the `?after=` cursor and the idempotent
#      played stamp;
#   6. the loop the two surfaces make together: an utterance posted over HTTP is
#      handed to `mesa live listen` exactly once, never twice, a quiet wait
#      prints `null` and exits 0, and the session's `working_since` opens when
#      the utterance is handed over, survives a reply and closes on the next
#      wait that finds nothing (task 894);
#   7. GET /api/live/turns/{id}/speak — the audio contract, the patched
#      streaming WAV sizes, the header arriving mid-render, no Content-Length,
#      `validation` for a pure-navigate turn and `unavailable` for a failing
#      synthesiser;
#   8. `mesa live look` (task 895) against a stub loki — the window box riding
#      in the route report and read back by `mesa live status`, its own
#      three-way key and the two-client scenario that made it one (a desktop
#      reports route+context+box, a phone reports a route alone, and the box
#      survives for `look` to match — task 1016), an impossible box refused,
#      and which window the box picks: the person's rather than
#      the headless `mesa` beside it, `unavailable` when nothing is at the box
#      (or no browser reported one), `conflict` when two windows are; plus the
#      speaker claim (mesa task 1267) — `POST /api/live/speaker` naming one
#      client, a route report carrying an id refreshing but never stealing it,
#      a second client's press moving it, the bounds, and `GET /api/live`
#      carrying it on the poll the page already makes;
#   9. the security boundary in default mode — the Host allowlist, the
#      Content-Type gate on every live write, and the agent gate on the four
#      routes that carry it (POST/DELETE /api/live, speak, the speaker claim)
#      contrasted with the plain guard on their neighbours;
#  10. the same boundary under `--lan`: Host skipped, Content-Type still
#      firing, and the agent-gated routes keeping their stronger gate;
#  15. the handoff (mesa task 1150): `mesa live handoff` spawning a successor
#      on the SAME session with the note and the last 10 turns appended after
#      the notebook and summary blocks, the same leading argv as the first
#      spawn (the cache-prefix invariant), the lease refusing the outgoing
#      agent's every verb as `conflict` while a lease-less person still
#      drives, the successor's first `listen --lease` stopping the predecessor
#      exactly once, a failed spawn leaving the session untouched, an empty
#      note refused, `mesa live context`'s key set (no `--quiet`), the page
#      seeing one session id throughout, and `handoff --quiet`'s key set;
#      plus delegate results (mesa task 1359): `live result` not_found with
#      nothing live, `listen` handing a result out once and before a waiting
#      turn as `kind: result` (never a turn, never on the page), blank and
#      over-16384 validation, the `--quiet` key set, a handoff naming the
#      outgoing agent's running delegate to the successor, and the
#      successor's listen leaving that agent running until its delegate
#      finishes, delivering the result posted after the handoff, then
#      stopping it once; a listen left waiting across a handoff ending in
#      conflict, and a later handoff or `live stop` stopping a predecessor
#      that is still deferred;
#  11. session memory (mesa task 921): the `mesa live summary` CLI round-trip
#      (set/show/list, the upsert keeping `created_at`), its `--quiet`
#      contract (drops `body` only; `list --quiet` is a usage error; `--quiet`
#      typed AFTER the text lands in the body, the `live say` trap), the
#      validation/not_found/usage error shapes, `live turns --session` reading
#      an ended session's turns, and the `live-summary` template firing on
#      `live stop` — argv shape, session name, one-argument prompt — with its
#      two guards (no turns spawns nothing; a second stop is not_found and
#      spawns nothing), the recall join proving the notebook AND the single
#      most recent summary reach the NEXT conversation's spawned prompt argv
#      (both after the session line, never before, the notebook first, and
#      no older summary riding along — mesa task 1147 cut recall from 5 to
#      1), the archive being append-only (a summary for a session older than
#      dozens of already-summarised ones still readable, every row kept),
#      and the project-delete cascade;
#  12. POST /api/live/transcribe (mesa task 954), against a stub `auris`
#      (MESA_AURIS_BIN): a real round-trip whose decoded audio reaches the
#      stub on stdin byte-identical to what was sent (never as an argument),
#      keeping the LAST `transcript` line among several and ignoring an
#      unrecognised `type` (auris's own extension mechanism), 200
#      `{"text":""}` for auris's exit 1 — silence (mesa task 1389) —
#      `unavailable` for any other nonzero exit, a run with no `transcript`
#      line at all, and a missing binary; a body one byte over the 25 MiB cap answered 413
#      validation naming the limit, still as JSON, distinct from 422 for
#      invalid/empty/missing base64; both halves of the boundary in default
#      mode (Content-Type, agent gate); and under `--lan` **both verbs are
#      present and relaxed, not absent** — a LAN POST reaches the stub auris
#      with the same argv, the GET answers `{"available": true}`, and the
#      Content-Type gate still fires;
#  13. the whiteboard (mesa task 1071): `mesa live board` — the four kinds and
#      where each body comes from (a typed body, `--file` with the kind from
#      its extension, `--image` stored as base64 with its `content_type` from the
#      inline-image allowlist, `--diagram` as an ESCAPED SVG snapshot a later
#      canvas edit cannot change), `--say` speaking a turn beside the board,
#      the required-source and required-destination ArgGroups and the rest of
#      the exit-2 usage errors (`list --quiet` among them), the bodiless
#      oldest-first `list`/`show` and the `--quiet` key set (drops `body`
#      alone), `keep` into an artifact and onto a task (decoded image bytes,
#      authored `naru-live`) with an image board refused the artifact and
#      pointed at `--task`, the retention bound pruning to the newest 20,
#      `clear`'s bodiless echo, and `GET /api/live/boards/{id}/render` — a
#      type per kind, nosniff, inline, byte-identical bodies and the artifact
#      CSP verbatim on the two document kinds — with the identical header set
#      in default mode AND under `--lan`, the absence of any route that writes
#      caller-supplied board content, and the render route answering 404 `not_found` once the
#      conversation has ended (the row survives like a turn's; every read of
#      it stops); plus ink (mesa task 1353): an utterance carrying a PNG and
#      its board id writing the PNG byte-identical under MESA_LIVE_INK_DIR
#      with `image_path`/`board_id` on the turn (null on a plain one),
#      `listen` printing both and `--quiet` keeping them, bad base64 / a
#      non-PNG / an unknown or foreign board / one byte over LIVE_INK_MAX
#      each 422 validation writing nothing, and `board keep --task`
#      attaching the ink as `<name>-ink.png` while `--project` refuses an
#      inked board;
#  14. live memory v2 (mesa task 1147): the `mesa live memory` notebook CLI
#      round trip (list/show/add/replace/delete/touch) with the `--quiet` key
#      set (drops `body` alone; `list --quiet`/`search --quiet` are usage
#      errors; `--quiet` typed after the text lands in the body, and after
#      search words is a word), `touch`
#      with no live session being not_found, every guard — the empty body,
#      the 600-char entry bound, and past the 500-word budget an add or
#      replace neither refused nor retiring anything (mesa task 1337: no
#      `evicted` key on the CLI or over the API, no row ever retired as
#      `evicted` — the dream pass owns the budget),
#      the 30%-removal rule refusing a delete above the 100-word floor and
#      allowing one below it, a replace judged on the words it removes — a
#      retired row surviving in `list --all` and in the archive, `search`
#      hitting a turn, a summary and a note with their `kind`s, `ref_id`s
#      and bracketed snippets, a query carrying `"` and `AND` searched as
#      words rather than erroring, an entry unused for N ended sessions
#      staying active as a retirement candidate (mesa task 1337: `live start`
#      retires nothing and says nothing, the dream prompt marks it
#      `, unused`, the stop at which it crosses the mark spawns a dream pass
#      and the next stop does not; `live memory keep` stamping `kept_at`
#      once, idempotently, with no live session, `--quiet` dropping `body`
#      alone, and a kept entry no longer marked `, unused`; an unknown or
#      retired id `not_found`), the four `/api/live/memory` routes
#      with both halves of the security boundary in default mode AND under
#      `--lan` (the Settings posture: `require_agent_access`, reads
#      included), and `GET /api/live` carrying no notebook (the 2s poll stays
#      bounded); then the dream pass (mesa task 1152): `merge` retiring its
#      sources as `merged` with `merged_into` pointing at the new row, which
#      carries the OLDEST source's provenance, both text bodies still
#      searchable, its refusals (one id, a repeated id, a retired or unknown
#      id, an empty body, no --ids) touching nothing, its removal guard
#      judged on the NET words and a merge past the budget retiring nothing
#      but its sources, `restore` un-retiring a
#      merged or deleted row (retirement fields cleared, nothing else moved),
#      past the budget too, and refused on an active row, the `--quiet` key
#      set on both, and `dream` — `--quiet` a usage error, `{spawned:
#      false}` under two entries, `conflict` while a session is live (never
#      spawning), the built-in `live-dream` template's argv with
#      DREAM_PROMPT plus every active entry line and no retired one in the
#      workspace cwd, and a configured template receiving `{prompt}`
#      byte-identical and `{id}` as the newest session's;
#  16. notice turns (mesa task 1157): `mesa live notice permission`
#      writing a mesa turn with the fixed text, no action and `notice` set,
#      the `--quiet` key set (drops `text`, keeps `notice`), the dedupe (a
#      second call answers the SAME id and writes nothing) and a fresh
#      `next_user_turn` span allowing a fresh one, a bad kind a usage error
#      (`stalled` included, removed by mesa task 1218) and `not_found`
#      with nothing live; `POST /api/live/notice`'s round
#      trip, its 422 for a bad/missing kind, its 404 with nothing live and
#      the Content-Type gate; `GET /api/live` answering `blocked: null` for a
#      plain stub job and `"permission prompt"` once the stub reports the
#      session's job blocked; and the notice absent from
#      `mesa live memory search` while the agent's own turn is found;
#  17. the automatic dream (mesa task 1155): `mesa live context` carrying
#      `dream` (null under threshold), a handoff under threshold resting
#      nothing and spawning no dream, two lookalike entries making `context`
#      report a reason and the next handoff spawn the `live-dream` template
#      beside the successor with `resting_since` set (on `live status` and
#      `GET /api/live`), the explicit verb still `conflict` while resting,
#      `listen --lease` waking the session once the stub reports the dream
#      job done (predecessor still stopped once), and `live stop` spawning
#      a dream over threshold and none under it.
