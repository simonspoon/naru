# Library gate (mesa task 919): exercises agents, skills, hooks, prompts and
# CLAUDE.md files stored as first-class records — create -> list
# -> show (by id and by name) -> update -> delete, the built-in fork/restore
# rule, version history, and the sync loop against real files on disk — over
# both the CLI (`mesa library ...`) and the API (`/api/library...`), against a
# throwaway MESA_DB and a throwaway HOME (this gate writes into `.claude`, so
# it must never touch the real one).
#
# Covers, in order:
#   1. CRUD over the CLI: create (positional/flag forms, --scope project),
#      list (bare array, built-ins included), show/get (by id, by name,
#      case-insensitively), update (patches one field, forking a built-in),
#      delete (echoes the full destroyed record), and the domain errors
#      (duplicate name -> conflict, unknown id/name -> not_found);
#   2. the --quiet contract: accepted on create/update/delete/show/get,
#      dropping exactly body+synced_body+builtin_body and keeping name;
#      rejected (exit 2, empty stdout) on list, versions and both sync subcommands; `update`
#      with no field flag is exit 2 usage with empty stdout;
#   3. the name rule — ../evil, a/b, .., ., and an empty name are each
#      `validation` on both surfaces, the traversal chokepoint a synced row
#      relies on;
#   4. built-ins: an unshadowed one lists with id:null, builtin:true; editing
#      it forks a real row carrying builtin_id; deleting the fork restores it
#      unshadowed; deleting an unshadowed built-in is validation; forking the
#      same built-in twice over the API is 409 conflict;
#   5. version history: a real body change appends a version (source "edit"),
#      a no-op update appends none;
#   6. the sync loop, for real, against files under the sandboxed $HOME/.claude
#      — mesa-new written to disk, disk-changed pulled in (appending a
#      sync-pull version), mesa-changed pushed to disk, a stray file adopted
#      as disk-new, disk-deleted resolved both ways (recreate vs. delete the
#      row), and both-changed offered as a conflict where `skip` leaves both
#      sides untouched — asserting actual file bytes, not just the JSON;
#   7. a CRUD round-trip over the API, the malformed-JSON/Content-Type cases,
#      and the fork route's 404/409;
#   8. the security boundary in default mode AND `--lan`: all eleven routes —
#      reads, authoring, both sync routes and both bundle routes — share
#      `require_agent_access` (mesa task 1004, replacing the old
#      loopback-only gate), so in default mode a foreign Host AND a foreign
#      Origin are each refused, while under `--lan` a DNS-name Host
#      (rebinding) and a foreign Origin (cross-site) are refused but a
#      genuine LAN page is served; plus the Content-Type gate firing on every
#      mutation in both modes;
#   9. the live conversation's agent definition comes from the library (mesa
#      task 1068, replacing the `live-agent-prompt` prompt task 919 had made
#      of `config.json`'s `live.prompt`): `naru-live` starts unshadowed as a
#      user-scope `agent` at `.claude/agents/naru-live.md`, appears in `sync
#      status` and is written to disk by `sync apply`, the spawned prompt
#      carries the session line ALONE, and editing it forks it with the
#      forked body replacing the built-in;
#  10. import/export (mesa task 963): a CLI round trip (a user row plus a
#      forked built-in export, with no unshadowed built-in and none of
#      id/synced_*/created_at/updated_at/path on an item), importing that
#      bundle into a second, empty db (bodies byte-identical, the fork still
#      carrying its builtin_id, a project-scoped item whose project doesn't
#      exist there failing alone while the rest of the batch still applies),
#      re-import (skip leaves bodies untouched, replace overwrites), an
#      unknown bundle version refusing the whole import with nothing written,
#      `--output` refusing to clobber an existing path, `--quiet` rejected on
#      both commands, and the two new routes added to the gate sweeps in both
#      serve modes;
#  11. hook registration in `.claude/settings.json` (mesa task 1115):
#      status -> enable -> status sees it -> disable, against a settings file
#      that already holds somebody else's settings and somebody else's hook,
#      which must come back BYTE-IDENTICAL; enabling seeding the hook's own
#      script to disk (executable, never overwritten) so the registration
#      never names a file that does not exist; a null `hooks` treated as an
#      absent one on both verbs; a second disable as a no-op success;
#      `--quiet` rejected (exit 2, empty stdout) on all three subcommands;
#      and the three routes joining the gate sweeps (now fourteen routes) in
#      both serve modes;
#  12. the command kind folded into prompt (mesa task 1139): a db holding a
#      pre-1139 `command` row opens as a prompt with `export_command` on,
#      same id and history; `--kind command` is validation; an exporting
#      prompt's file is BYTE-IDENTICAL to its body (cmp) and `sync status`
#      reads in-sync the moment it is written; `--no-export-command` removes
#      the file mesa wrote but leaves a hand-edited one for `disk-new`; the
#      flag survives `--quiet`; and a bundle still saying `"kind":
#      "command"` imports as an exporting prompt;
#  13. hooks wired from outside `.claude/hooks/` (mesa task 1128): against a
#      settings file holding an unrelated key, somebody else's registration,
#      an in-tree command, `bash $HOME/scripts/warm.sh --fast` under two
#      events and a `~/gone/missing.py`, `hook orphans` lists exactly the two
#      out-of-tree rows (exists true/false, two registrations on the first,
#      the in-tree one absent); `adopt` on the missing one is exit 1
#      not_found; a pre-created `.claude/hooks/warm.sh` makes it conflict
#      with the settings file untouched; a real adoption moves the script
#      (executable), rewrites both commands keeping `bash ` and `--fast`,
#      leaves every other byte IDENTICAL (cmp against a sed of the
#      original), shows two registrations on the new item and in-sync in
#      `sync status`, and drops out of `orphans`; `--quiet` rejected on
#      both; and the two routes serving over the API (both sweeps in
#      section 8 now cover sixteen routes).
#  14. a built-in changing under a fork (mesa task 1349): a fresh fork of
#      `inbox-triage` is not flagged; a legacy NULL base and a simulated
#      upgrade (`builtin_base` set to an older body in sqlite) flag it in
#      `list`, `show` (and `--quiet`, which keeps the flag and drops
#      `builtin_body`) and `sync status`; `library builtin keep|take|merge`
#      each clear it (keep leaving the body, take writing the built-in and a
#      version, merge writing the given body), with the usage/validation
#      refusals; and `POST /api/library/{id}/builtin` doing the same with its
#      404/422/415 shapes; and a fork exported and imported into a fresh db
#      arriving with no base, flagged. Both gate sweeps in section 8 now
#      cover all eighteen library routes, the import preview included.

# All ELEVEN library routes share ONE gate — `require_agent_access`, the
# agents'/terminal's/scripts'-run gate (mesa task 1004, replacing the old
# loopback-only `LIBRARY_LOOPBACK`) — reads (list/show/versions/export) as
# much as the five mutations, the two sync routes and import: a row's body IS
# an agent definition, a hook shell script or a CLAUDE.md, so there is no
# coherent line between reading one and writing one. In DEFAULT mode that
# gate is a loopback peer + a local Host + a local Origin, strictly stronger
# than the loopback-only check it replaced. Every curl below originates on
# this machine, so the server always sees a LOOPBACK peer — what these
# assertions pin is the Host/Origin half of the gate (the peer-address half,
# and the fact that `--lan` now lets a real LAN page IN, are pinned by the
# Rust unit tests in api.rs).

# ================= gates: --lan mode =================
# `--lan` skips the GLOBAL Host allowlist, and under it `require_agent_access`
# RELAXES rather than refuses (mesa task 1004): the peer no longer has to be
# loopback, so a phone on the network can use the Library page at all — the
# same posture /api/live/transcribe takes, and the one --lan already takes for
# the terminal and for running a script. What it does NOT relax is either
# confused-deputy defense (`require_lan_page_access`): a DNS-name Host is a
# rebound page and a foreign Origin is a cross-site fetch, and both are still
# refused, on all ELEVEN routes alike. Every curl here originates on this
# machine, so the real TCP peer is ALWAYS loopback — the "a genuine LAN peer
# now gets in" half can only be forged in the Rust unit tests (see api.rs).
# What curl CAN prove, and what this section proves for all eleven routes
# exactly as scripts-check.sh proves it for scripts' authoring routes, is: a
# DNS-name Host is refused, a foreign Origin is refused, and a genuinely local
# request (IP-literal or localhost Host on our port, no foreign Origin) still
# succeeds — the flag never locks the machine's own owner out.
