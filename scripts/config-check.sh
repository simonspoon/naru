# Config gate: proves the spawn hooks in ~/.mesa/config.json actually replace
# the built-in `claude --bg …` argv — for the todo-watcher, the inbox-watcher
# and the Agents surface's spawn route — that every hook runs as one bash
# script with its values quoted in (mesa task 1143), and that a missing or
# broken config behaves the way docs/config.md says. It also covers the
# pricing, watchers, keymap, speech, live and listen sections that share the
# same file — the last of these (mesa task 955) names the model `live transcribe`
# runs the external `auris` binary with, the input-side mirror of `speech`'s
# `kokoro-rs` voice.
#
# The config file is read at its REAL default location, so HOME is pointed at
# a throwaway dir (MESA_CONFIG_FILE, the unit tests' seam, would sidestep the
# path resolution this gate exists to check). That also suits the
# inbox-watcher, which dispatches in $HOME/.mesa/workspace.
#
# Two stubs stand in for the outside world: `mytool` (the replacement command,
